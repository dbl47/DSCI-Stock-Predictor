{"2021-01-01": ["Hello [r/davinciresolve](https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/)! Welcome to the first official FAQ/FAQ Friday of 2021! I'm doing these to help people with common questions, the \"dumb\" questions you're afraid to post (there are no dumb questions, trust me), and *slowly* get enough feedback/input to make a wiki!\n\nOf course, I can't (and shouldn't) be writing this alone, so please tear apart what I've written, ask any questions, offer your favorite resources/tips, and help make it a useful resource for everyone.\n\nThis week's post is about the differences between the Free and Studio versions of Resolve. It's more of a list of what's \"locked\" to the Studio version - if you've got more information or thoughts on how this should be better organized, feedback is, as always, appreciated. (Sources cited at the end, for further reading)\n\n**Note on v17:**\n\nVersion 17 is still in a public beta. Bugs are to be expected. It's strongly suggested that you start with 16 if you rely on Resolve for professional/paid work, or you're just starting out. Some exciting new tools are included in Resolve 17, and they're noted as being specific to 17 where applicable.\n\n# Media Importing and Processing\n\n* Deinterlacing\n* 3:2 Pulldown\n* Face Detection\n* 10-bit H.264/H.265 Codec Importing\\*\\*\n* GPU Accelerated Encoding/Decoding of H.264 and H.265 on Windows; Import/Export of H.264 and H.265 on Linux\\*\\*\n* AMD-Accelerated H.264/H.265 Decoding Support^(+)\n* Multiple GPU support\\*\\*\\*\n\n# Editing Tools\n\n* Superscale\n* Speed Warp (Retime Algorithm)\n* Timeline creation using CPLs (v17 Studio only)\n* Smart Reframe (v17 Studio only)\n\n# OFX Plugins\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Aperture Diffraction|Analog Damage|Automatic Dirt Removal|\n|Chromatic Adaptation|Chromatic Aberration|Color Stabilizer|\n|Contrast Pop|Deflicker|Dehaze|\n|Dust Buster|Face Refinement|Film Grain|\n|Lens Blur|Lens Distortion|Lens Flares|\n|Lens Reflections|Patch Replacer|Pencil Sketch|\n|Sharpen|Sharpen Edges|Soft Sharpen Skin|\n|Stylize|Warper||\n\n**Coming in v17:**\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Detail Recovery|False Color|Motion Trails|\n|Noise Reduction|Smear|Texture Pop|\n\n* Improvements to Revival, some Blurs, and Film Grain OFX plugins\n\n# Color Page Tools\n\n* DCTL support\n* Spatial/Temporal Noise Reduction\n* Object Removal\n* Dolby Vision HDR\\*\n* Lens Correction\n* 3D Stereoscopic Tools\n* Remote Grading\n* Dust Removal\n* Magic Mask (v17 Studio only)\n\n# Fusion Tools\n\nIf somebody braver than I wants to read the 1581 pages dedicated to Fusion or spend hours in Resolve to find a comprehensive list of tools exclusive to the Studio version, please do share your findings. All I can offer offhand is 3D Camera Tracking is currently a Studio-only feature.\n\n[Fusion's got a dedicated comparison page between Fusion in Resolve and Fusion Studio.](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/compare)\n\n# Immersive Audio Formats\n\n* Dolby Atmos Audio\\*^(+)\n* MPEG-H Audio^(+)\n* SMPTE ST.2098 Audio^(+)\n* Auro-3D Audio^(+)\n* B-Chain Audio^(+)\n\n# Rendering &amp; Exports\n\n* Render resolutions greater than 4K UHD\\*\\*\n* Remote Rendering\n* ProRes Rendering on Linux\\*\\*^(,) \\*\n\n# General Studio Features\n\n* Collaboration (subject to change with v17, which is still in beta)\n* [Frame.io](https://frame.io/) integration\n* Remote Scripting API Access (*Most* of the Python/LUA API is accessible from the console in Resolve, and this is more important for Fusion anyways.)\n* Video Clean Feed - fullscreen video playback on a GUI display without the need for a Decklink or UltraStudio and a broadcast monitor.\n\n# Sources, Asterisks, and Further Reading\n\n**Sources**\n\nThe only *official* document I could find is for [v15, but most of it's the same.](https://documents.blackmagicdesign.com/SupportNotes/DaVinci_Resolve_15_Feature_Comparison.pdf?_v=1523288400000)\n\n[Here's one article](https://www.toolfarm.com/tutorial/in-depth-davinci-resolve-studio-vs-the-free-version/) I found that lists most of the differences.\n\n[I checked every plugin in the Free version of 16 and screenshotted what works because I was too lazy to type it out.](https://imgur.com/a/R5L4aZ2)\n\n**Asterisks**\n\n\\*Separate licensing and/or additional hardware may be required\n\n\\*\\*[Supported Codecs Doc](https://documents.blackmagicdesign.com/SupportNotes/DaVinci_Resolve_16_Supported_Codec_List.pdf) offers more information on these\n\n\\*\\*\\*Except on macOS systems pre-built with 2 GPUs, apparently - you get 2 and then need Studio.\n\n^(+)Source is [v16 New Features Guide](https://documents.blackmagicdesign.com/SupportNotes/DaVinci_Resolve_16_New_Features_Guide.pdf?_v=1554708600000)\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n[An older article from Mixing Light on buying Studio from the Mac App Store vs. Dongle/License-based versions.](https://mixinglight.com/color-grading-tutorials/davinci-resolve-studio-on-the-mac-app-store-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n[**Previous FAQ Fridays**](https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/?f=flair_name%3A%22FAQ%20Friday%22)", "I found similar item(s) posted recently: \n\nItem | Price | When | Vendor\n:-|:-:|:-:|-:\n[Ryzen 5 5600X Instock ](https://redd.it/k2ao3q)|$699|34 days ago|newegg\n[Ryzen 5 5600x ](https://redd.it/k82is7)|$409|25 days ago|pc-canada\n[Ryzen 5600x ](https://redd.it/kcztvk)|$529.99|18 days ago|aeromalls\n[AMD Ryzen 5 5600x ](https://redd.it/kk31jd)|$450|7 days ago|pcvonline\n[Ryzen 5 5600X ](https://redd.it/knx5fa)|$382|1 day ago|bhphotovideo\n\nI'm a bot!

If you plan on buying a laptop in 2021 it might come with usb 4.0 which would be \"equivalent\" to thunderbolt 3.0", "It's a pain to leave behinf the AU's, but I recommend you leave Hackintosh alone, now that the ARM/ M1 switch is in the pipeline you may as well just move to Windows 10 as ARM Macs are going to kill the Hackintosh scene dead for a while. \n\nMoved from Mac to PC for work stuff years ago, then I switched from an i7 6800k over to a Ryzen 9 3900X this year and the experience is a night and day difference in terms on latency on my audio interface, the amount of plug-ins I run concurrently (usually several instances of Reaktor, lots of Max and a hefty amount of external instruments ) and the general speedy feel of Live. \n\nIntel still marginally outpace AMD in some gaming and tasks that aren't optimised for multi-thread stuff, but there's no getting around the price to performance value AMD's new chips offer.", "If you really wanna make a hackintosh then compatibility and stability with MacOS is probably more important than the minor difference you would get from a new comparably priced AMD/Intel CPU. I would assume that Intel CPUs would have the advantage there since there are no official AMD Macs.", "I have latency issues with AMD. Nothing that stops me from doing what I want but at times a bit of an inconvenience. They're quite common when running DAWs and audio software on AMD.

Ofc the R9 is in a league of its own but the AMD experience is better than Intel on Ableton right?", "True. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still considering Intel. AMD hackintoshes aren\u2019t really the most stable computers, and I imagine using Ableton on it would just be bad.", "If that leak is actually real 2021 might possibly be the worst year for Intel in history.

Hopefully, at $300 - $320.", "If Apple are completely switching chipsets then moving on to a dying platform is a bad move - I just upgraded my 2017 Mac Pro to Big Sur and that messed up a bunch of old stable go-tos on my machine, if you're investing in a new set up invest in something you know will last, the Hackintosh scene is over for a while.\n\nAs for the 6800k to a 3900X comparison read a bit further down my post, I feel any of AMD's offerings are better value price to performance wise than Intel's these days. Intel dropped the ball and AMD are offering some really fantastic CPU's that compete at any price point.", "I had a rare, but very bad experience with an amd motherboard not being compatible with any controllers that feature flying faders or my BCR2000, which to me is kind of indispensable.\n\nThey simply wouldn't communicate properly and even worse seemed to be sending my units improper voltage. Neither AMD nor HP would help me out, so I had to sell the computer at a loss.", "And smaller cache.

AMD is indeed the better value and hence I\u2019m here asking for advice", "Both companies make good and bad CPUs and I think it\u2019s a bit disingenuous to say one company is better to the point where you would even notice a difference performance wise. What you will find, however, is that you can get a pretty decent AMD processor for cheaper than an Intel one. Remember that MacOS has had a lot of optimization for Intel CPUs over the years, though.", "I am so a big fan of AMD, but I figured I'd share. Just make sure whatever chips you get you look up compatability beforehand and not make my mistake.", "AMD hackintoshes are entirely possible, but they are also more unstable, and you NEED a dedicated GPU that is somewhat recent, because AMD iGPU's (on the few chips that have them) are completely unsupported by macOS.\n\nIf you want a hackintosh, go with intel, because there is less kernel modification needed (more stability) and most intel iGPU's on core ix processors are supported by macos (just make sure you dont buy an F or KF cpu, as they dont have iGPU's)\n\nIf you want to build a hackintosh, definitely check on r/hackintosh . Their wiki is incredible, and it provides links to guides and lists of parts to avoid or buy.", "Yeah, I think AMD will release 5800 to combat this, with a 65W TDP maybe?\n\nProbably not $300 though.

Also, you should keep in mind that there's Raja and former AMD PR crew at intel who were not shy at using some questionable marketing tactics (just remember how rx480 was marketed) so I'd hold my breath.

The TDP of a CPU is essentially how much power a CPU will pull. The higher the TDP of a CPU, the more power is drawn, so more heat is generated, so more to cool. \n\nAMD has 65 Watts, 95 Watts, and 105 Watts TDP CPUs. The Ryzen 5 3600 you selected is a 65 Watt CPU. 65 Watt CPUs can be easily cooled with a simple budget to midrange air cooler. The 105 Watt CPUs need either a high quality air cooler, or liquid cooling. The 95 Watt CPUs are somewhere in between.\n\nSo for your Ryzen 5 3600, most simple air coolers will do the trick. But I do see people go for liquid coolers often since liquid coolers often have cool rainbow RGB fans, but that's just for aesthetics.\n\nNow for SSDs. For gaming, read and write speeds don't really matter that much. What matters is just that you are using an SSD instead of a mechanical hard drive.

Really not a bad CPU at all.\n\n\n4 cores\nAES, AVX and AVX2 instructions\n\nCache:\n\nL1i: 2 x 96 KB\n\nL1d: 4 x 32 KB\n\nL2: 2 x 1 MB\n\nMemory: 2 channels supporting DDR4-1866\n\nThe GPU is integrated with the CPU (on the same chip.)  Therefore, I wouldn't recommend using the GPU for mining.\n\nYour CPU doesn't have any L3 cache, so its Monero (RandomX algorithm) hashrate probably won't be the best.  You should try mining Monero by mining alternative coins at [MoneroOcean](https://moneroocean.stream/) mining pool.\n\nYou will need a Monero address to mine to.  For this, it's best if you setup the *official* Monero GUI or CLI.  There are instructions on how to do this... I've never used the GUI and I don't use Windows.  I would only be helpful at telling you how to setup the Monero CLI on Linux (Ubuntu.)  But once you get the *official* Monero software setup and you have generated a Monero wallet address for yourself, then you can try mining with xmrigMO.  *Official* Monero wallet software downloads and instructions on setting it up are here: https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/\n\nOnce you have a Monero wallet address, you can start mining.  Download the latest release of xmrigMO [here.](https://github.com/MoneroOcean/xmrig/releases) Unzip it and put your Monero address in the config.json file (it tells you where to put it.)  On Windows, 7zip is the best for unzip/zip, you can download that [here.](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900-x64.exe)\n\nAfter you edit config.json to include your Monero wallet address, run xmrigMO (xmrig.exe) as Administrator.  It will take ~2 minutes testing many different mining algorithms and it will automatically save your CPU's performance for each of those algorithms in the config.json file.  This tells MoneroOcean pool which algorithm your CPU can mine best and the pool will automatically tell your CPU which algorithm to mine based on whichever one is most profitable in real-time.  You can go to Moneroocean.stream and paste in your Monero address to watch the progress of your miner.  MoneroOcean has no mining fee (0%), just a small withdrawal fee for withdrawals under 4 XMR (Monero.)  The pool makes money to pay for operations from these withdrawal fees and from the trading fee deltas (when the pool automatically sells mined altcoins for Monero; every miner gets paid in Monero.)  I use MoneroOcean pool and I've never had a problem with it.\n\nI think your CPU would be most profitable mining *panthera* algorithm.  This algorithm mines well on high core counts with high clock speed without needing the L3 cache Monero needs for best hashrate.  Your CPU will probably get quite hot mining *panthera* because it's a very core intensive mining algorithm.  You can still mine regular Monero (*RandomX*) to MoneroOcean pool as well, you just won't get the best hashrate without L3 cache.  Maybe ~200 H/s on your CPU.  You'd probably get ~500 H/s on *panthera* (average ~80% profitability of Monero) so equal to ~400 Monero H/s.  Monero (RandomX) isn't very core intensive (it uses more RAM memory) so it won't get as hot when mining.  I think your laptop should be fine to mine on... I've mined on many laptops without issue, but they don't get much hashrate.  Also mining will damage your laptop's battery over time.  This is because you need to leave your laptop plugged in to mine and leaving it plugged in keeps the Li-ion battery at max voltage which is bad for the battery cells.  If your laptop has a removable battery, I recommend removing it and mining with the laptop plugged in (without the battery) so it doesn't stress the Li-ion cells.\n\nI hope this helps you get started.  Beware of 3rd party software for Monero wallets and/or for mining.  There are a lot of phishing scams out there.  It's best to use the *official* Monero software releases (verify the checksum hash like it says on getmonero.org) and avoid miner scams like minergate because they fake your hashrate and skim (if not outright steal) from you."], "2021-01-06": ["AMD AM4 Ryzen 7 3700X Eight Core 3.6GHz 65W CPU 100-100000071BOX\t\t\n\nCooler Master A71C AMD RGB CPU Cooler RR-A71C-18PA-R1\t\t\n\nGigabyte AM4 Mini-ITX B450 I AORUS PRO WIFI DDR4 Motherboard\t\t\n\n16GB DDR4 G.Skill (2x8GB) 3200Mhz Aegis RAM F4-3200C16D-16GIS\t\t\n\n500GB Crucial MX500 2.5\" SATA SSD Drive PN CT500MX500SSD1\t\t\n\n1TB Seagate 3.5\" 7200rpm SATA 6Gb/s \nBarraCuda HDD PN ST1000DM010\t\t\n\nMSI RTX3060Ti 8GB VENTUS 2X OC PCIe Video Card\t\t\n\nMSI ATX MAG VAMPIRIC 100R RGB Tempered Glass Mid Tower Black Case (No PSU)\t\t\n\n650 Watt Cooler Master MWE Power Supply MPE-6501-ACABW-AU\t\t\n\nIntegrated Sound Card\n\t\t\nIntegrated Network Connection\n\t\t\nIntegrated WiFi\t\t\n\n80mm Deepcool Case Fan", "As an AMD fan, in this case Intel makes more sense.", "I have an AMD FX-8350, so i know how capable this old chipsets are but your gpu will be your bottleneck.\nHonestly, if you upgrade your gpu to something more recent (GTX 1080 ti or above) you could run most modern games at mid to high settings at 1080p.\n\n- Fortnite, \n- Unturned, \n- Any Source Engine Game\n- Minecraft Java (at 720p)\n\nThose are a few i can think of at the top of my head, but i highly recommend going to \"can i run it?\" And seeing what's available for you there \ud83d\ude01\n\nHope this helps!", "Fortnite Recommended System Requirements\n\nIn order to run Fortnite on recommended settings, we suggest a Core i5 2.8GHz processor or greater, 8GB of system RAM, and a 2GB video card such as the Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU.\n\nAs for other games, prolly not anything new in regards to AAA unless you want to play lowest settings &amp; resolution with poor fps.

I believe it would be best to go with DisplayPort.\n\n&gt;I would really like to get a 1440p screen but I am not sure if my GPU can sustain it. Any idea?\n\nDepends on the game. Cyberpunk? Absolutely not. Even my GTX 1080 is not having a good time at 1440p with that game. But if you just play Minecraft and e-sports titles, you'll be fine. Otherwise it might be best to stick with a 1080p monitor.\n\n&gt;Will the performance improve if I would use just the monitor rather than extending the screen?

In reality, it makes no difference.\n\n&gt;Shall I look for a g-sync compatible monitor?

Ideally you would get a Mini DP to Normalsized DP cable, as DP would Utilize VRR (Gsync/Freesync) and have an easier time with higher refresh rates. I know my montior wont go over 60hz with hdmi. If all you have is an HDMI cable though, it will work fine, albeit at 60hz.\n2. A 1060, especially combined with the limitations of a laptop, is far better suited for a 1080p screen. It will struggle at 1440p. Unless all you play is competetive shooters and minecraft on lower settings. If you want to push higher refresh rates definitely go 1080p. Bear in mind due to pixel density, you wont want to go over 24 inches at 1080p. Some say 27 looks fine, but personally it looks pixellated to me.  Pay attention to panel type too. TN VA and IPS.  They all have their advantages and disadvantages, but in a very small nutshell, TN prioritizes responsiveness at the expense of colours, IPS prioritizes colours at the expense of black levels, VA prioritizes black levels at the expense of occasional ghosting and black smearing.  There is obviously much more to it than that and there are exceptions to the rule etc.\n3. In reality, no.  As far as I am aware, extending the screen, or setting the monitor to the primary display, does not have a significant effect on performance.\n4. You have a video card that will be compatible with G Sync (Nvidias Tech). Free sync is AMD technology and would only be compatible with their cards. While you definitely want G sync for PC Gaming ( i Would not consider a display without it), Free sync will not hurt if it is there, but dont pay extra just to have it. Bear in mind some displays say Free sync (G sync compatible). These generally work for nvidia cards, but some monitors dont behave as well as a monitor labelled just g sync, so that would require looking at reviews of the specific monitor. Some free sync (g sync compatible) monitors are reported to flicker when using g sync.\n\nI hope this helps.", "There is no real point in 'lightly' overclocking a Ryzen CPU due to the way multi core and single core clocks are managed on those CPUs.

But it'll be plenty for work and trading, with support for 4 monitors.\n\nThe 3700X is a great all-around CPU for both gaming and workstation tasks. It has good single-core performance for gaming and will last a long time thanks to its 8c/16t.\n\nThe 3700X comes with an okay stock cooler, but it can get quite loud and toasty under load. So I went with the standard Hyper 212 Black. It'll be perfect for the 65W TDP 3700X while operating quietly thanks to a lower RPM required.\n\nI chose a high value B550 motherboard. It has good connectivity and power delivery while also offering WiFi and Bluetooth.\n\nI included 32 GB of fast 3600 MHz CL18 RAM, which should be useful for having multiple trading apps open and plenty for gaming.\n\nI chose a 500 GB NVMe SSD as your boot drive and for your frequently used programs/games.   I also added a 2 TB HDD for your media and other games. On the flip side, you could get a [1 TB SSD](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/zR3H99/adata-sx8200-1-tb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-asx8200pnp-1tt-c) instead of this SSD+HDD combo.\n\n**The GPU is not widely available** due to major shortages in stock and sky-high levels of demand. And for this budget, I wouldn't go with any other GPU than the RTX 3070, as it's great for 1440p gaming. It's not relevant for your work or trading (besides displaying a lot graphs) but you'll need it for your \"pretty crazy monitors\". You'll have to monitor r/hardwareswap or sites like Amazon/Newegg/CanadaComputers/MemEx for restocks, but I guess you're used to that with trading.\n\nThe Meshify C Mini is a fantastic case, with excellent airflow and cable management. It comes with two fans; I added one for more airflow and positive pressure, which should prevent dust build-up in the case.\n\nThe PSU has great value right now. At 650W, it's perfect for these components and it has fully modular cables. It has excellent reviews and has good protections. The only downside is the 3 year warranty but it's a high quality unit so it'll last 10+ for sure.\n\nLet me know what you think :)", "Hey OP \u2014 Tech Support posts are only allowed in the [Q4'20 Tech Support Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/j5xy4o/q420_tech_support_megathread/)\n\nYou may also wish to visit /r/AMDHelp and /r/TechSupport", "1.

You might want to familiarize yourself with [buying used GPUs](https://youtu.be/J2VkkEHDG5E).

When you upgrade, the A1000 can be made a boot drive while all your important work can go on another PCIe 4.0 SSD and/or you can get a prosumer-level SATA3 SSD like an 870 EVO/860 Pro or MX500. If NVMe drives are cheap in the future, you can always wipe the A1000 SSD and replace it with another PCIe 4.0 SSD.

The 3070 is overpriced for what it has, just 8 GB of VRAM. Thats fine for a 400 but not 700-800 \u20ac card. The AMD GPU will offer the better longetivity overall.", "Its strange to have only 8 Gb in the long run considering that AMD had put 16 Gb\n\nWhy do you think that make a difference in the long run?", "Yeah Nvidias steam encoding is just a lot better than AMDs right now.", "&gt;I am going to give a concise explanation to my reasons why I think that you should not buy a 5600x or 5800x regardless of stock. I see many people recommending the 5600x or 5800x and I have to say that seems dumb in my opinion. They are not bad CPUs they just aren't competitive. I will start with the 5800x and why you shouldn't buy it. It has an msrp of 450$ and has 8 very fast cores, but it is not a good value whatsoever. The 10700k and 9900k can now be had at 100$ less and during Christmas for 150$ less and they both have 8 slightly slower, but still very fast cores. That is not taking into account that the 10700k and 9900k are in stock.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;People are now buying AMD just because well AMD is better haha intel 14nm I comedy. Just to make people realize how dumb this is 3 years ago intel released the 9900k for the same price as the 5800x although it sold for 50$ higher, but it was in stock. Everybody was bitching about it like oh who would buy a 9900k the 2700x is 150-200$ less and it has 8 cores. Now tell me would you consider a 2700x a cpu worthy of a 3090. The 9900k was worth the money over the 2700x although over the 3900x and 3700x it became a hard pass. Now we are in this same situation 3 years later except the 5800x is the really expensive cpu and the 9900k is the cheaper option.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;People were bitching about the 9900k at release even though the price at the time wasn't crazy, but when AMD does the same thing 3 years later nobody blinks a fucking eye. What I am trying to say is that the 5800x just doesn't make sense. I mean look the 10850k is going for 400$ and the 3900x should be going for 400$ too. The 5800x is just a really bad value and nobody should buy it. Next up is the 5600x and this one is one that really gets on my nerves. The 5600x is not the deal ok. Just because you saw a benchmark showing it had higher fps does not mean it is worth the 300$.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Bench marks never tell the whole story and we must consider that for 300$ you should probably get an 8 core chip in 2020. We have been seeing intel beat AMD in gaming for years and nobody was ever like oh yeah we should only get intel because look at those fps numbers. Now when AMD does the same thing and charge a price premium over intel for slightly better gaming performance everybody praises it. The 5600x is 6 cores for 300$. Like what the fuck the 8700k came out 4 years ago and it was 870$ for a 6 very fast cores and people were like, but bro Ryzen is so cool. The 5900x and 5950x are great value in my opinion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;and personally when looking at the 8 core chips a 10700k looks really nice for the price.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHey /u/Zucini-noodles, it looks like you posted a wall of text.

Mum adressed all these problems to him he said my life I want to live however I want you don't have a saying. To that mum tightened finances. Pops lied to her wanting to spend more maybe due to envy seeing splurge even though being not being on the condition to do so(bad financial decisions).

The Intel Z590 chipset does *not* provide Gen4, it is Gen3, just like Z490/Z390/Z370, etc. Only the primary PCI Express slot(s) and one NVMe M.2 are connected at Gen4, via the CPU when used with an 11th generation series CPU.\n\nZ590 boards *do* include a wider x8 DMI 3.0 link (\\~8GB/s) between the chipset and CPU, which will help alleviate bottlenecking in cases where several additional drives or peripherals are used simultaneously, but anything connected to the chipset is still just Gen3. Z490 and older use an x4 DMI 3.0 link, for an effective \\~4GB/s between the chipset and CPU, so this is still a good upgrade for anyone working with video editing or other large local files.\n\nSome board manufacturers will work around this by switching lanes between what would normally be a second slot in a typical x16/x0 and x8/x8 mode setup, so instead of x16+x4 for the main slot and NVMe M.2 drive, you'd end up with x8+x4/x4+x4, allowing three full speed Gen4 NVMe M.2 drives, but running the GPU at x8 as a compromise.\n\nGigabyte's [Z590 Vision G](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/Z590-VISION-G-rev-10#kf) is one such example, allowing a total of [four NVMe M.2 drives](https://imgur.com/a/YOlk0R0) (three Gen4 via CPU, one Gen3 via chipset, with the GPU at x8).

The other thing that might make the motherboard obsolete, in the sense that it can't be used for the next generation future tech, is that the DDR5 memories will probably be out sometime around the end of this year, and the physical form factors for each generation of the DIMMs for the DDR3/DDR4/DDR5 are different.

But Lisa, I'm wondering, how much -- there were some news presses in the calendar third quarter that perhaps the ramp on the gaming side had incurred some more costs than originally expected. But I guess, importantly, when you look at gaming as a percent of mix and the fact that Q3 is kind of the first gaming quarter which just tends to be the lowest gross margin quarter, it strikes me that September should be a gross margin bottom for the overall business. I'm wondering if you could just help me understand if that's a fair comment and how I should think about improvement in gross margin in gaming over time.*\n\n***Lisa Su*** *-- President and Chief Executive Officer*\n\n*Yeah. Sure, John. So certainly, we ramped heavily the console business here in the third quarter. I think we were right at our margin guidance.*\n\n*As we go sequentially into the fourth quarter, we saw -- we see an increase in margins from 44% to 45%. I think there are a couple of aspects there. So we do have the console business growing sequentially. And so that is a bit margin-decretive.*\n\n*However, we also have our other businesses growing as well that offset that. It is true that the early parts of the console ramp are -- typically, we're working through some ramp issues. I would say the ramp is going quite well, and the demand environment is very strong overall. And we continue to work on satisfying all of the demand.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Lisa confirmed \"we won't be able to meet demand in any segment\" until well after Nvidia has a steady supply of Tis and Supers to undercut our ~~$549~~ ~~$579~~ ~~$799?~~ cards. \n\n *Lisa Su discussed the timeline for a recovery, saying,* ***\"****Paul, we are shipping a lot of parts.

If the cc does not clarify that situation adequately I'm going to increase my diversification pace and take the 3.8% tax hit.  If AMD continues to not satisfy demand all year it will cause significant negative consequences for the long term thesis even though the revenue and profit keep growing.  AMD has to gain as much share as possible while Intel and nVidia are not in a position to strongly defend their turf.  This shows a weakness in AMD's future.  In the past nVidia booked wafers (shoving out tons of low end GPUs) to starve AMD when demand exceeded their supply.  Now both Intel and nVidia could use their market power to squeeze out AMD's supply of substrates.\n\nI've seen this story play out multiple times before.

When that has happened it has never ended well for AMD.", "Those 2 things don\u2019t really conflict.  The limiting factors are wafers/substrates and possibly other components.  But the reason this is a limit is because of projections due to seasonal demand.  Remember wafer bookings needs to be done well in advance, especially for the latest nodes.  So let\u2019s say in 2018-19, TSMC asks AMD how many 7nm wafers they will need for 2021.  AMD will make those projections based on their roadmap and seasonal demand so it would make sense that they would book less wafers in 1st half of 2021 compare with 2nd half (as Su said AMD is second half weight).

You have a 6 core chiplet and an 8 core chiplet. For the 5900x and the 5950x they get 2 chiplets, then if they don't make the cut in testing apparently AMD is disabling one chiplet and selling them as 5600x or 5800x. I'm sure they have 8 (or 16 for that matter) core CPU's that can't pass the required testing to earn the 5800x title, next in line would possibly be a 5700 at this point. I could see if they do exceptionally well at that level, the may earn the \"X\" badge when there are enough chips in this category. \n\nTheir goal is always to have the highest yield per wafer, they don't want to throw anything out.

The amount of ignorance in this post is stunning. \n\nYou seem to be under the impression that AMD and Nvidia physically make these products. They don't. AMD is contracting with TSMC for their new generation of product. Nvidia is contracting with Samsung. Samsung's process is brand new and has been having a huge amount of wafer failures. It's very likely the reason the 3060 Ti exists is because it's the same die as the 3070, but it didn't pass QC. AMD, on the other hand, is using TSMC's 7nm process, which is capacity constrained at the moment because AMD's new Ryzen CPUs are also being manufactured with the process. There's only so much production capacity with these materials, and adding production capacity is an investment of literally billions of dollars, and literally takes years to do (source: I work in semiconductor supply chain). \n\n&gt; They can sell what they want at whatever price they want\n\nAgain - you don't know what you're talking about. Nvidia and AMD have contract rates to the different graphics card manufacturers. MSI, Asus, Gigabyte, etc, they all buy from Nvidia and AMD at pre-negotiated rates on *VERY* air-tight contracts. Nvidia and AMD are happy in that they can sell every chip they can make, but they aren't making additional money on these items just because the market price is inflated. And even then - the graphics card makers sell their products at pre-negotiated contract rates (though that actually is increasing due to new tariffs going into effect, but that's only passing the tariff onto the consumer. There's no profit being made on this). The only people that make additional money on these items are the retailers if they so choose to increase the cost, and the scalpers. \n\n&gt; postpone the release date\n\nSo that tech press can post [hit pieces speculating as to why they pushed it back?](https://hardwaresfera.com/en/articulos/amd-no-termina-presentar-las-amd-rx-vega-nvidia-retrasa-volta/)\n\n&gt; Why are there only 2 actors in this market ?\n\nBecause GPU production is *INSANELY* expensive.

The next day I was posting an add on DL for another man to join her in the bedroom. So, few weeks of them talking she decided to meet him and have him over for drinks. The man was definitely the alpha type and took control of the situation. Slowly grabbing her leg and hand, finally he just leans in and kisses her. My girl turns to me to see if I reacted and I had the biggest grin on my face and my cock was rock hard. She starts making out with him and climbs on top of him. Few moments later he was sucking on her huge tits and rubbing her pussy through her jeans. I was just watching this event unfold still not believing it was real. He took her to our bedroom and she revealed her lingerie (which she has only worn once for me in 6 months) and started touching her everywhere. He started to finger her, pretty violently in my opinion but she was losing it. I couldnt believe that he made her squirt, a feat I have never accomplished. He stood up and she undid his pants and starts blowing him. The guy was fairly large and thick, Im only 5-5.5\" myself and he had some length on me. She bends over in front of him a few minutes later and he starts fucking her, without a condom. I couldn't fathom this and within a few moments I covered in my own cum.

Plus, the quality is worse than QuickSync....\n\n... which would actually be my first recommendation. If you haven't already, enable your iGPU in your bios, and you should be able to select QuickSync in your encoder options. It's not going to be as good as the quality that you can get with x264, but it will be better than AMF encoding, and also not eat up CPU cycles nearly as much as x264.\n\nIf QuickSync doesn't get the quality you need though, then honestly your best bet would be to switch out your GPU for an Nvidia card (preferably GTX 1660 or higher, so you have the new Turing encoder), and use Nvenc for your encoding method. As long as it's set up correctly, it has minimal impact on system performance since the encoder is separate silicon from the rest of the GPU's processing.

I use these in my production servers and I don't have any issues.\n* Case: The case you chose should be great for this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith regards to the gaming PC, here are my recommendations:\n\n* CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600\n* RAM: RGB option --&gt; G.Skill TridentZ RGB 16 GB DDR4-3600; Non-RGB option --&gt;  Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB DDR4-3200 C16 \n* GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2070 8 GB --&gt; this is great\n* PSU: Cooler Master MasterWatt 550W --&gt; this is a great\n* Motherboard: MSI B450 Gaming Plus --&gt; this is a great\n* Case: Phanteks Eclipse P600S --&gt; this is a great.

Of course finding the GPU is going to be the big hurdle and I still have to figure out peripherals.\n\nBudget w/o peripherals is looking to be \\~1.3k to \\~1.4k\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/q7yNW3)\n\n|Type|Item|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/g94BD3/amd-ryzen-5-5600x-37-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100000065box)|\\-|\n|**CPU Cooler**|[Deepcool GAMMAXX 400 Blue 74.34 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/w3c48d/deepcool-gammaxx-400-blue-7434-cfm-cpu-cooler-deepcool-gammaxx-400-blue)|$24.99 @ Amazon|\n|**Motherboard**|[MSI B550-A PRO ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/7gxbt6/msi-b550-a-pro-atx-am4-motherboard-b550-a-pro)|$139.99 @ B&amp;H|\n|**Memory**|[Crucial Ballistix 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3600 CL16 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/2TFKHx/crucial-ballistix-16-gb-2-x-8-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-bl2k8g36c16u4b)|$86.99 @ B&amp;H|\n|**Storage**|[Samsung 860 Evo 1 TB 2.5\" Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/yzfhP6/samsung-860-evo-1tb-25-solid-state-drive-mz-76e1t0bam)|$109.99 @ Adorama|\n|**Storage**|[Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5\" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/mwrYcf/seagate-barracuda-computer-2-tb-35-7200rpm-internal-hard-drive-st2000dm008)|$54.99 @ Newegg|\n|**Video Card**|[NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti 8 GB Founders Edition Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wvgQzy/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-8-gb-founders-edition-video-card-900-1g142-2520-000)|\\-|\n|**Case**|[Lian Li LANCOOL II-X ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/kRFKHx/lian-li-lancool-ii-x-atx-mid-tower-case-lancool-ii-x)|$97.98 @ Newegg|\n|**Power Supply**|[EVGA 600 W 80+ Certified ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4FH48d/evga-600w-80-certified-atx-power-supply-100-w1-0600-k1)|$58.15 @ Amazon|\n|*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts*|||\n|**Total**|**$573.08**||\n|Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2021-01-19 23:57 EST-0500|||\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Many thanks to any and all who comment :)", "I found similar item(s) posted recently: \n\nItem | Price | When | Vendor\n:-|:-:|:-:|-:\n[AMD Ryzen 5 5600X -](https://redd.it/kw3wz4)|$399.94|7 days ago|amazon\n[AMD Ryzen 5 5600X in stores at Central Computers in the Bay Area California ](https://redd.it/kw5pvk)|$315.95|7 days ago|centralcomputer\n[AMD Ryzen 5 5600X -](https://redd.it/kxhv2p)|$299.99|5 days ago|microcenter\n[AMD Ryzen 5 5600x in Stock at Amazon](https://redd.it/ky6x6j)|$399|4 days ago|amazon\n[Ryzen 5600x,](https://redd.it/kzyv95)|$299|2 days ago|walmart\n\nI'm a bot!

Are you OC it too?\n\nAlso what is your PSU rated at?? and what GPU do you have?", "&gt; Can a cheaper motherboard(H310m) handle a powerful graphics card?\n\nThe motherboard will not make much (if any) difference. The CPU can, depending on what you're trying to run, at what resolution, and a host of other factors. \n\n&gt; I am planning to use an i5 9400f\n\nIt's OK. Depends on the price when you grab it. On PCPP in the US, an i5 10400F runs about $20 more than the 9400F, and a B460 motherboard runs like $10 more. So $30 gets you a much more capable CPU. \n\n &gt; Do you recommend an AMD alternative for a similar price to squeeze out more performance?\n\nWhen times aren't fucking crazy, absolutely. But times are what they are, and AMD CPUs are just too goddamn expensive right now. \n\n&gt; Also is 700W PSU enough?\n\nDepends. Build quality matters every bit as much as wattage. Is a 700W BeQuiet Straightpower 11 enough? Absolutely. Overkill even. Is some terrible-ass EVGA N1 700W enough? I wouldn't run my worst enemy's computer on it. \n\n&gt; is the intel stock cooler enough for this considering\n\nIt's enough to keep it within operating temperatures (i.e. less than 90C). It makes no guarantees of quiet operation. \n\n&gt;  and running on a tight budget.\n\nThen don't waste money on things like 5 case fans. Most cases come with one or two.

AMD is faster, but not $80 worth faster.", "First the easy question- a GBA emulator will work on literally any computer you can find in Best Buy today. A $40 Raspberry Pi will work just fine.\n\nAt the risk of being annoyingly long winded, I want to try to answer your other questions as well. \n\nRegarding CPUs, when Intel introduced the i3, i5, i7 line, they oversimplified things to the point that they're actually more confusing now. \n\nThere are 11 generations of i-series processors, and every generation gets at least marginally faster. There's a $300 laptop at Walmart right now with an \"i7\" CPU, but it's slower than the current gen i3 models. (see: [https://www.walmart.com/ip/EVOO-15-6-FHD-Ultra-Thin-Notebook-Intel-Core-i7-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Blue/485370791](https://www.walmart.com/ip/EVOO-15-6-FHD-Ultra-Thin-Notebook-Intel-Core-i7-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Blue/485370791)). As a rule of thumb, an Intel CPU will drop in relative performance to the next \"i\" level about every two generations. So a 9th gen i7 is roughly equivalent to an 11th gen i5. \n\nTo make things a little more confusing, there are still 8th-11th gen Intel CPUs in laptops on the shelf at Best Buy, AND even within the same generation, you have higher and lower powered variations. \n\nAnyway, my point with all of this is, if you're looking for an \"i7\", you're doing it wrong. If some nerd told you to look for an i7, he either doesn't know what he's talking about or he didn't feel like you would understand.\n\nAs for Intel vs. AMD, in recent generations, the Ryzens have typically outperformed their Intel counterparts. Just so you're aligned, Ryzen 3 = i3, Ryzen 5 = i5, Ryzen 7 = i7. As for generations, 1st gen Ryzen (Ryzen 3 1200, for example) is roughly in line with 8th gen Intel (core i3- 8xxx). 2nd Gen Ryzen = 9th Gen Intel, 3rd Gen = 10th, and so on.\n\nAs for brands, IMO they are all pretty equal. HP has a billion 2-in-1's, and they're all called something or other (Pavilion, Envy, Spectre, etc.)  x360. Lenovo has a bunch as well. Some are called \"Flex\", but they also have plain Yogas and use \"Yoga\" to modify Thinkpad. \n\nAnyway, based on your use case, I think I would go with one of these options below. I'm not against HP or Dell, I just don't know of any deals right now that knock my socks off. \n\n**$600**: Ryzen 5 4500U CPU, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD... This is a plasticky build, but very decent specs.

They've invested literally billions of dollars into R&amp;D on these things. Investments that aren't seeing returns unless they can move units. \n\nAnd a lot of folks assume that when GPU prices are high, Nvidia and/or AMD are raking in extra money. In truth, they aren't making a dime extra. They sell their GPU silicon to board partners at pre-negotiated, contract rates. Those board partners then sell the completed cards to pre-builders and/or distributors for pre-negotiated, contract rates. The only people that make extra money from high GPU prices are scalpers and/or vendors if they decide to raise prices. \n\nAdditionally, AMD/Nvidia don't even physically make the items. Samsung currently makes Nvidia's offerings, and TSMC makes AMD's. Both are running at max capacity and are not able to keep up with demand. And adding capacity takes years and literally billions of dollars, so it's not like they can simply add more production capacity. \n\nIt really sucks that we're in the situation we're in, but it's simply the only way it can be. The semiconductor industry is *not* nimble. It's just not possible to be.", "AMD is definitely gonna be a $100 stock soon IMO.

That comment might have been a little bit too deep of a dive - just get \"normal\" DDR4 RAM and you'll be fine.\n\nAs for the amount of RAM, most people currently recommend 16GB of RAM for gaming builds. The \"default choice\" for this would be 2x8GB, so 2 sticks of 8GB each. 4x4GB will also work, but it's more expensive usually. Do not get a single RAM stick (1x16 or 1x8) if  you can avoid it! Safest choice is just 2x8GB.\n\nFor an AMD Ryzen CPU, the RAM speed also matters a lot, so be sure to get at the very least DDR4-3000 RAM, 3200 or even 3600 would be even better. Above 3600 MHz RAM is usually too expensive to be worth it.", "Well get a M1 MacBook Pro, get a virtual machine with windows: be faster than most other laptops. So until the new mobile AMD processors are released they are worth it.", "Doesn't change that I'm looking forward to the cognitive dissonance if the AMD version also is 'not better IQ' after all the shade that gets thrown at DLSS.", "I doubt it would be, the whole point of them is to provide a good image while running at a lower resolution to save performance, especially for heavy effects like RT.\n\nIts much faster to run RT at low resolutions.\n\nThey are meant to boost FPS not IQ. DSR / VSR already are higher IQ for performance hit. If AMD has a mode that runs similar performance but upscales to higher than native it could look better than native, like DLSS 2x was supposed to do.

On water is between 45-50C under max load.\n\nDual 360 radiators loop vs a Noctua D15 will see max 5C difference, maybe close to 10 if you let it run for hours.\n\nMost heat is coming from the chiplets which are smaller than your finger tip.\n\nYou have 2 chiplets that are very powerful and dense. From those you have to transfer that heat to the nickel plated copper heatspreader via solder and then to the cooler via thermal paste or liquid metal.\n\nThere is no way to absorb that heat fast enough from such a small heat producer trough 3 layers of stuff. (solder, heatspreder, tim) And this is harder when the load is on \"one small point\" from a single die. Also you cpu heatspreader is not made to perfection. A slight bend or dip will have to \"use\" more thermal paste which in turn will reduce the heat transfer by a small bit. Same goes for cooler and for the cpu dies itself.\n\nOpen prime95 and run small fft for 10 min. After the first min reset the temp monitoring and check again after 10 min. You will see you cpu will stay lower in temps.\n\nAfter that open chrome and watch the max cpu temp. You will get a higher max temp than prime, but this not mean that the chip uses the same power, it is just unable to dissipate that heat quick enough.\n\nThis happens in all chips in every application, but the algorithm that temp is reported is different. AMD reports multiple times per second to software, maybe others add a buffer to the low level code and report an average of the last 5 seconds to the software, so you will see lower temps, but in reality it is the same\n\nFor comparison, I have an old VW Polo.

I just saw thing called PBO2, Precision Boost Overdrive 2, which from my understanding should be a newer better version of PBO.\n\nIt supports 500 series chipset motherboard and 5000 series CPU's only( I think ). And in a particular video showcase I watched, the person was able to reduce a 5900x's temperature from 90 degrees (not safe) to 81 degrees (not safe, but safer) running a Cinebench benchmark, and reducing the voltage to the cores by around 0.05 - 0.10 ( I cannot remember the exact voltage), while achieving a higher school in the benchmark.\n\nI wonder if PBO2 could fix the heat issue that the Ryzen 7 5800x has, so it doesn't reach to 85+ degrees under any cooler you give it.

The density would be so much lower that the 40CU midrange chips would end up being nearly as expensive to make as the 80CU parts on 7nm. They would also clock lower and use more power.  \n3.

TSMC keeps expanding its production lines. It's entirely possible that TSMC's added capacity is more than GF can add.\n\nEven if GF can help, then, like others have said, this requires quite a bit of work. It's not a stop-gap solution. Work will have to go into the design, and money (quite a bit of it) will have to go into purchasing the software for such designs. Then it's up to AMD to decide if that expenditure is worth it and will bear fruit, considering the time to market.\n\nIf anything, it seems to me that it makes more sense to produce CPUs at GF. CPUs are more standalone, less feature-dependent (such as ray tracing or DLSS for GPUs) and tend to offer less of a generational leap. AMD is still selling 14nm and even 28nm CPUs. Backporting more modern designs to 12LP+ could potentially result in decent chips.\n\nAgain, AMD will need to decide that the effort is worth it.\n\nIt's worth noting that AMD still has an agreement to buy wafers from GlobalFoundries until 2024, and while AMD still has enough stuff to produce there, it's entirely possible that AMD will retire some products and replace them with new products.", "Weren't they refreshed like 3 months ago?

Note that datacenter talk was the only thing perking up AMD's AH stock price when Su was able to give a more positive, detailed answer on DC growth. \n\nI think that in prior years, they were discounting EPYC heavily to gain a beach head. That's why we got market share growth but much less revenue growth and margin impact. They've been careful to shield EPYC sales from scrutiny by mixing it with custom.

They don't want the narrative of what was bound to be a hard slog to get in the way of adoption.\n\nEPYC is why I'm so excited for 2021. I think this is EPYC's year with Rome and Milan to start to be a major impact on the financial statement for the whole fiscal year.

The narrative you get is \"AMD is superior in every way for gaming on Linux, and you should never get Nvidia, and Nvidia performs worse than AMD on Linux.\" Which is objectively false in every sense. \n\nOn the whole, Nvidia performs better than AMD on Linux (Because on the whole, Nvidia has better cards than AMD, but that's decreasing). On the whole, an Nvidia card that's 7% faster than a specific AMD card on Windows will also be around 7% faster than that same card on Linux.

Hopefully this goes smoothly but NVIDIA has wasted a lot of time trying to push EGLStreams now switching to DMA-BUF. We'll see how it all shapes up.\n* One thing I didn't like about NVIDIA was both my Adaptive Sync monitors always got this problem of the screen blanking off and back on. This happens when the frame rate drops below the adaptive sync range or there was some kind of slight stutter (as you may get when playing a game in Proton/WINE). And no amount of editing the range in the monitor's EDID will fix it. And one monitor is certified as G-SYNC compatible. I even bought an expensive DP cable. Since switching to AMD I haven't encountered this issue. However its hard to tell if Adaptive sync is enabled even though its reported enabled in Xorg.0.log and xrandr. But I haven't encountered any screen tearing. This isn't just a problem on Linux but Windows users on NVIDA also have this flickering/screen blanking problem. But I don't care what happens on Windows and it seems like NVIDIA's low framerate compensation doesn't work properly.\n* Potentially better Cyberpunk compatibility as Valve added an extension. Possibly this could be a trend going forward.\n* I own a Valve Index and AMD GPUs support Async Reprojection and NVIDIA GPUs don't.\n\nAt any rate, some people won't care about any of this and NVIDIA works fine for them.

I haven't been excited about their GPUs and probably won't be for a while, but I'm hoping they do MCM (multichip module) w/GPUs and hopefully that can bring prices down (especially for lower-end) at least until they get a foothold.

You get the benefits of being able to use Windows for some games, but you don't have to dual boot, and you don't have to run Windows on bare metal. That's the setup I have, with my 5800X and RTX 3090. I have a single-GPU passthrough VM where I pass through the 3090, 16GB of RAM (I have 32GB total), and 12 threads (6 cores), so basically my VM has equivalent performance to a bare metal machine with a 5600X and RTX 3090. But since all the games I play except one work on Linux, I use Linux for everything else, and only launch the VM when I want to play Apex. \n\nHowever, if they're BattlEye, you can't use a VM, regardless of whether you do dual or single GPU passthrough, as you will get kicked because BattlEye banned VMs. \n\nRX 580s suffer from the AMD reset bug which is a pain in the ass to work around, and it prevents you from being able to launch the VM twice in one boot, you have to reboot every time you want to launch the VM, which defeats the purpose. \n\nBut honestly, if I were you I would sell the 1080 Ti and the 580 both and get a 3080 instead.

And with the GPU team it's even worse, it's like pulling teeth to get them to address bug reports, and there are numerous bug report threads with dozens (or hundreds) of affected users STILL experiencing **system-breaking** bugs, and there hasn't been a comment from an AMD driver dev in several months. I saw a shitload of people in those threads (because I was one of the afflicted users) flat-out say \"this response from AMD is some of the worst I've ever seen, and I'm gonna have to switch to Nvidia\" and actually followed through with the switch after only ever using AMD prior to that experience. Hell, that's what happened to me, too. I ONLY ever used AMD for CPU **and** GPU, but after the RDNA 1 experience, with two separate cards, and seeing everything I saw, I'll be goddamned if I buy another AMD GPU until I see that shit's changed. I still go with AMD for CPU, but that's almost by elimination at this point because Intel is so much worse in pretty much every way when it comes to value, business practices, core count, etc.", "I've been on all AMD fo a while because of open source driver support. I've generally found that nvidia is less stable and requires deep changes to the mesa stack.\n\nI really wish that for some of the deeper hardware features we could get closer parity with windows, afaik, gpu driver crashes are still unrecoverable, Multi gpu support isn't decent, and we still don't use the graphical system to report a kernel panic despite this being a capability.", "Keep in mind that if you get this chip you need to buy a video card. It doesn't have a built in GPU. Fortunately, neither music production nor schooling should require much, but GPUs are a little tougher to get than usual right now, so factor that price in. \n\nSome slower AMD cpus have graphics built-in, and have a \"g\" at the end. All intel CPUs do unless they end in an \"f\". In your case the similarly priced Intel i3 10100 might work: 4 cores vs the 6 here, but each core is faster, and graphics are built in.

Sure it presents the most 'easy' setup, as in it will most likely be supported out of the box, for those distributions on the rather cutting edge, TLS may not be good options for newer hardware (i.e release within the previous six months to the release of the distro itself).\n\nStill going AMD may mean losing some features that are really easy to use with nvidia, particularly nvenc.

Look through intel\u2019s 10th gen line and find a cpu that fits your budget but meets your needs. i5 9600k is also a solid one but from the 9th gen.\n\nGPU: The 3000 series at MSRP was insane power for your money, but these are now priced up and difficult to find in stock. The 1660super is great value and good power. I don\u2019t recommend buying any of the 2000 series GPUs at your budget.\n\nRAM: DDR3 is outdated, everything you\u2019ll find now is DDR4. Intel isn\u2019t huge on speed, so 32GB of 3000+ MHz should be more than enough. RAM prices also are pretty low right now. \n\nMotherboard: Just look through recommendations of boards that work for your CPU and have all the gadgets you want. I went with the MSI MPG Z490 myself.\n\nI also recommend messing around on https://www.userbenchmark.com. They take results from real PC tests to rank every CPU, GPU, RAM, etc against each other based on cost, value, performance, and more. There\u2019s also a comparison feature where you can pit two components against each other side by side.

You state one of the reasons.\n\n- AMD's contract isn't to continue production of 12nm I/O dies, but to use the GF processes. It's also continuing to produce Picasso and Dali there, for example, which are sold in Chromebooks and other products. It could produce other things, potentially. Although the global agreement is until 2024, the current terms are up to 2021, so AMD will be re-negotiating it anyway. It's an interesting question if AMD will do anything new at GF, but I don't think it's a real obstacle to anything.\n\n- According to the leaked roadmap, Rembrandt is DDR5/LPDDR5, so indeed no DDR4. I haven't seen anything to suggest that Warhol will be DDR4 (if you did, let me know), but it's possible that it will be. I don't know what Warhol will be, but it's possible that it's just enabling some stuff in Vermeer because Vermeer was rushed, kind of like Lucienne is for Renoir. As for AM4, I still expect Cezanne to be released for it at some point.\n\n- Far as I understand, RDNA/RDNA2 are based on N7, not N7P. Rembrandt is rumoured (that leaked roadmap) to use N6. Raphael (next gen desktop CPU) is expected to use 5nm. Warhol is expected to be 7nm.\n\n- LPDDR5 is already available and used in phones, so I see no problem releasing a mobile chip without DDR4 support. I'd expect Rembrandt to follow AMD's normal mobile cycle, so Q1. Intel is expected to release Alder Lake in September, and that should include DDR5 support.\n\n- I don't think there's much to learn from AM2+. The market is different these days, and although it's possible that there will be transitional products (perhaps Alder Lake will be like that), we've already seen AMD release only higher end products with the 5000 family, and I think it's possible that we'll see a new DDR5 high end platform while AM4 will be the lower cost platform, with older gen Zen cores, until the DDR5 ecosystem settles.\n\nEdit: Looking at your profile, I see that the only previous post you made is of a roadmap of sorts, without any real backing of the predictions, and which seems a little iffy (for example, Cezanne is said to have PCIe 4). It will be interesting to know how you came to some conclusions (like Warhol being 5nm).\n\nRegarding Warhol, if it's indeed a DDR4/DDR5 product, then my guess is that it will ship with two different I/O dies rather than a single one for both.", "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u3001\u30ed\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30fb\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3084\u4ed6\u306e\u88fd\u54c1\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\uff08\u30b6\u30a4\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u8cb7\u53ce\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u5834\u5408\u306b\u306f\u3001APU\u3084FPGA\u306e\u751f\u7523\u306a\u3069\uff09\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30b5\u30e0\u30b9\u30f3\u306e8nm\u307e\u305f\u306f\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u8a08\u753b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \u3053\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u306f\u5927\u76ee\u306b\u898b\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001AMD\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u5ea6\u306e\u4f4e\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u4f4e\u3044\uff08\u3064\u307e\u308a\u8981\u6c42\u5ea6\u306e\u4f4e\u3044\uff09\u88fd\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306b\u5916\u6ce8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3001\u751f\u7523\u6027\u3092\u3055\u3089\u306b\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306a\u304f\u3001\u53ce\u76ca\u6e90\u3067\u3042\u308b\u9700\u8981\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u610f\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u6d41\u901a\u91cf\u3055\u3048\u5897\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3069\u3053\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3051\u3069\u3001\u6027\u80fd/\u30ef\u30c3\u30d1\u304c\u3042\u304b\u3089\u3055\u307e\u306b\u4e0b\u304c\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u52d8\u5f01", "Debt doesn't necessarily need to be used on stock buy backs, but rather anything the company wants.

It seems well deserved their struggles.\n* Intel is famous for adding \"artificial\" limitations to their hardware. AMD supports higher memory frequency  (with budget motherboard) and even the cheapest processor is unlocked for overclock.  The last mid-end and low-end mobos for Intel will support only one generation of processor....why? (Really, I'm curious to know why)\n* They're trying to underplay Apple and AMD products with some PR bullshit.\n\nIt's a enthusiast thing. From a casual consumer perspective, the products itself are very good.

Currently with the 10850k at 350$ intel is the obvious choice. AMDs closest competitor is the 3700x and that has 2 less cores and has much worse single core. Zen 3 is overpriced except for the Ryzen 9s because if you want the best you have to pay up. Intel is seen as unsexy because people are a hive mind and like to root for AMD like they are their friend when they are company that the moment has the public advantage starts selling 6 core cpus for 300$. AMD has done some great things and had it not been for them the 9600kf would be 4 cores and so would the 9700.", "It is all marketing. Their good will has the intent to steal market from others.

That is Intel frequently had overclocking blocks or limitations in overclocking and still do on most of their chips while the majority of AMD chips throughout again their history have been overclockable and at times unlockable.\n\nFrom in the deep ATi past you had cut down GPUS that could be unlocked and overclocked to offer astonishing value. On the cpu side once we got to quad core phenoms you had cut down 3 and 2 core chips which were often unlockable and again amazing value compared to the competition. \n\nThis still happens now and again but it depends on the chips and reasons.

It is not a good offering due to it's lack of availability and whilst it is a good performer in productivity I remember that just over a year ago people were saying \"oh if you are gaming, just get AMD you only loose 5fps in games\". \n\nI remember even in the days of Zen+ I was recommending people to get a Ryzen 5 2600 over an i5 8600 because of things like Intel having a 14nm shortage, and that with the GPUs you would of been pairing those parts with (something on caliber with an RTX 2070 at most) you would see a 10% performance loss with AMD at most, and that was if you wasn't GPU bound, but it was worth it over things like having to wait for the i5 to be in stock. I am now in the reverse position for Intel\n\nWhilst AMD is a good performer, you can get the i9 10850K for the same price as the Ryzen 7 5800X, and the i9 is more readily available.

Their tests aren't conducted in realistic environments and they only give a seal of efficiency - which is kind null for a desktop PC these days. There's a list of Gold rated - quite expensive - PSUs that get trashed by Bronze ones. \n\nNow, for the question at hand. FSP vs CV, it's hard to say without going deeper into each model however my instinct is to go towards DC-DC. Group regulation these days is just a signal of older design, which Corsair CV does have since it's an upgraded (barely) Corsair VS. And the FSP does promise a nice set of protections.\n\nTake a gander at some EVGA alternatives where you are as well, EVGA BQ is quite good (also DC-DC). Furthermore, the 650W version of the Corsair CV is also DC-DC (similar to EVGA BQ is most respects), mayhaps it can be found at an agreeable price.\n\n&gt;What are the implications of said PSUs in a modern day gaming system (Ex. AMD Ryzen 5 3600 + AMD Radeon 5700 XT)?\n\nWell you already took the most important step, that is _not getting a piece of garbage_, so the major risks we warn against are out. Neither PSU listed will risk your system albeit I would tell anyone to avoid Corsair CV and VS if possible for they can generally be found at similar prices as better units, however, a budget is a budget, and I'm south america, I know how tough markets can get (if you'd like to send me link to a retailer I can check for alternatives as well).\n\nFurther implications may occur when it comes to idle states for CPUs. In such states modern CPUs will drop their core voltage quite low, and some group regulated PSUs on the lower end cannot maintain stability in its lines and does 'cause BSOD - a BSOD easily remedied by turning off a setting in the bios, but a bsod nonetheless.\n\nWhat all that said, it is a whole another story if one is considering serious overclocking, in which case a PSU with better regulations is recommended to avoid VRM stress.\n\n&gt;Will these things matter if I made a build made completely out of components from 5+ years ago ( before Intel introduced Haswell, ex. Intel i7-3770K + AMD Radeon HD 7970)?\n\nProbably not unless you plan to take the 3770k for a overclocking spin.", "I'd consider holding off on a GPU until the market is less insane or buy a used GPU. If prices were normal, that GPU would be a third of the price or you could get one 4x as good for that price. Right now, you could buy a used GPU like a 2060 Super or 5600 XT that is 3x as good for that much or a 1660 Super that's over 2x as good for ~$220-250. \n\nThe first list below has an integrated GPU that could get you by if you wait. \n\nThe second list is assuming you buy some GPU now and changes other parts to be less expensive or better performing. You don't need such an expensive mobo. One that's half the cost will perform just as well and have everything you need. The RAM is faster, the one you've selected is equivalent to DDR4-3200 CL16 and too often has issues reaching its rated speeds. The PSU you've selected is overkill for a 1050 ti or any lower power GPU.

Fact is nvidia and AMD has a very specific retail price for each product. Now explain to me how it became much higher if it had a retail price? Oh what can they do? Very simple. Punishments. They have a well built supply chain and they can track everyone there. If a store is selling too high you investigate all the way up the supply chain. Of course they won't. Why? Because why spending money on investigating while you can get double or triple the money from scalpers? To sum it up. They fuck us up because of greed.

So either way is fine but since he already have motherboard that can be used with Zen 3 CPU why not use it?

I'm in agreement that if this has been an ongoing issue with no real attempt to fix, it's hardly AMD's fault.", "Availability or not, I think that AMDs hand is somewhat forced here. They can't just sit around and let nVIDIA have the only SKUs in this price tier for months and months. I am surprised that they've let the 3060Ti sit around for so long without a competitor tbh.\n\nI think it would have been good to snipe the 3060 launch so that the 3060 would be compared to the 6700/6700xt rather than the other way around, but I imagine they have good reason to hold back a bit (be it drivers or building up inventory or component shortages).\n\nI guess this would be around a 3060Ti, possibly following the same pattern as the higher tier cards - winning or being closer at 1080p but falling away slightly as the resolution increases.", "Cpu- ryzen 7 5800x or ryzen 9 5900x.\nA general rule of thumb is that intel processors used to outperform AMD in gaming, but to be very honest you won't really notice or register those extra few frames.

So probably target something around 1440p. Get a second hand Intel or AMD platform then jump to am5 or Intel ddr5 platforms when they arrive. It should be 2021 end or early 2022. Zen 3 will be aging very fast and very badly when that happens, it will look silly and might depreciate faster than you think in the used market.\n\nOFC if you are getting a pc for work or productivity purposes, no point waiting.

Since you want to use for both gaming and 3D rendering, you'd need a processor with higher thread count. So I selected the 5800x. The motherboard, PSU and SSD are very well reviewed. I assumed you need a monitor in the budget so included a 27\" IPS, 144Hz monitor. The budged comes to 135k leaving about 35k for your GPU (3060Ti FE). If you don't want a monitor, you can go for 3080 FE GPU or save some on the monitor (Optix G241) and get a 3070 FE.

I recently built my PC with AMD parts and I'm having the exact same issue. The only solution for now is to revert to an older driver for your GPU or wait for AMD to fix the issue.", "That's a very good question. It made me refect on the current standing of players in Semi space.\n\nAMD primarily plays in the CPU/APU market and works on the x86 architecture. The other big player in the CPU market is Intel. But in teh broader definition of Semiconductor you have players like Samsung and SK hynix who are absolute behemoth in the memory market. Infineon, Renesas are titans of MCU. TI is leader when it comes to Analog.\n\nNow coming to the question - Why don't tech giants acquire AMD. Here's my take\n\n1. AMD's share price has increased multifold since the release of their new generation of Ryzen processors. This would mean that the acquiring company has to pay a premium to acquire the company.\n\n2. It would take a couple of years before the hardware and software get integrated completely. Even then, the processor is just one element; the acquiring company would still have to source other chips from other companies.\n\n3. Tech Giants are focussed on software rather than hardware, and it is a good thing. As consumers we get better software experience across multiple devices.\n\n4. Assuming Microsoft acquires AMD, it has to take a stand if it wants its software to run exclusively on AMD chips and the existing partnerships. If so, then they would be loosing a maor chunk of the market serviced by Intel. This would also cause massive outcry as customers with Intel chips would be worried about the software support; and considering many companies worldwide are invested in Intel based products would degrade MSFT's standing.\n\n5. By not acquiring AMD, MSFT can be architecture agnostic i.e. they can work on developing a version of Windows that would run on ARM chips. On the premise of ARM being better for mobile computing, it makes sense that MSFT doesn't latch on to only one architecture.\n\nSpeaking of competition, there is already a fierce competition in Semiconductor space, there is massive consolidation taking space. Every few months you can see that the companies are either getting acquired/merged. So, unless there is any breakthrough that would disrupt the semiconductor space, the consolidation will continue as most of the offerings are slowly becoming commodity products.", "Let me give an analogy - Lets say Mercedes Benz announces that they had an automation break through, and a new Mercedes Benz is now going 3D print cars which will cost half the price of a Honda Civic. The new 3D printed Mercedes will be just as good quality as the previous models that cost 2-3 times as much. \n\nHonda and the other car companies might decide that they need to stop making cars, and figure out how to obtain this new 3D printing machine to make their cars even cheaper. If they produce any cars, they will be losing money if they have to sell it for less than half price. \n\nA month later, every dealer ship sold out all the cars they have afraid of the new Mercedes Benz. No one can buy a new car, as Mercedes is about to destroy the market. Mercedes then announces that they will have 3 cars this weeks, but many more cars next week. The next week Mercedes then releases 5 cars. \n\n8 lucky people buy the new 3D printed Mercedes, and 4 sell it on eBay where it goes for double. \n\nWhen Mercedes spits out thousands of these a months, then other companies are in trouble. Right now, all the other companies got scared, so none are making cars. As a result if someone wants to buy a car, none are available. This causes the price of existing cars to skyrocket. \n\nThis is similar to graphics cards, except the same companies make both. When they release the 3050, 3050 Ti, 3060 (and the barely released 3060 Ti) - this destroys every graphics card from $100 - $500 on the market. The $500 3070 \"destroyed\" every graphics card from $500-$1,500. \n\nCompanies are scared to make the old graphics cards, because as soon as these new cards are available, their old cards are worthless. As a result, they're focusing on ramping up production for these new cards instead.  \n\nNow to answer your question, the 1650 Super is a 4GB 1660 (1660 is normally 6GB) and they're often about the same for gaming - the 1660 was usually a terrible choice. \n\nFor the past 2 weeks, everything has been sold out. A month ago there were some cards under $150 available; except for these everything else has been mostly sold out since December. I've tried ordering several 1650 Supers and have received emails saying they have been permanently discontinued. In a few months the RTX 3050 will come out for $150-$185 and probably beat most $200-$300 cards like the 1660. \n\nIf you can wait a few months, there's going to be good choices. Until then, your best bet is to buy a used 1050 Ti, 1060, etc. \n\nAs for the rest of your build. Intel and AMD traded places. Reviewers and YouTubers review products at launch, but prices change over time. \n\nThe i5-10600 used to be $180-190, and the Ryzen 3600 was $170 making it a much better choice. Today the i5 is $140 and the Ryzen 3600 is $200 - the i5 is a much better value option. \n\nThe Ryzen 3100 used to be $99 and the i3-10100 was $139 - the 3100 destroyed the i3. Today the Ryzen 3100 is $160-$190, and the i3 is $120 - Intel wins. The i3-10100F was released, it's supposed to be $90, but keeps selling out and trends at about $115-$125 as well. \n\nUnlike the Ryzen 3000 series CPUs, the Intel offers integrated graphics standard, the F CPUs don't have integrated graphics. The Ryzen 3000G CPUs with integrated graphics are actually Ryzen 2000 processors with graphics added. \n\nBasically AMD's top of the line beats Intel's, and AMD is now the premium choice. AMD embraces this and deliberately wants to charge more than Intel because $$$. \n\nIntel realized they can't make a better product than AMD, so instead they slashed their prices so they now have way better prices than AMD. \n\nThe i3-10100F or i3-10100 with a B560 motherboard would be the wisest choice."], "2021-02-21": ["I've done a lot of research and I've finally decided on all the parts I want to include in my build.

I assume you want to take advantage of the 3080 so I went with 1440p 165 Hz. If you want a bigger screen you can get the S3220DGF, which is 32' and VA (I have one, it's great).\n\n- Mouse + keyboard is going to be mostly personal preference. I don't like Logitech keyboards much but it looks like they're the only companies making decent wireless stuff nowadays. The Logitech G Pro is a pretty good mouse from what I've heard, battery lasts weeks.\n\n- 3 case fans, totally optional.

In this department AMD just nudged out intel with their newest series, but rumors are that 11th gen intel parts will be back on top.\n\n2. Budget. In this case AMD wins hands down. They've used the same cpu socket for the past few generations of ryzen processors, so the parts have been out on the market for years, have a long use history, and can be picked up relatively cheaply, often used in great condition.

Except people tend to forget that AMD has claimed to be premium now, they're \"big boys\" so they should get the same treatment imo\n\nI'm saying this with an AMD CPU and almost went with an AMD GPU too", "Added the list as an edit to my previous comment! I'll add some tips and tricks below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're building from scratch, here are the important things:\n\n\\-Motherboard. Should have enough input and output to attach everything and avoid adapters/dongles/splits as much as possible, and it should have at least one M.2 slot, preferably 2, for a high speed SSD (more on that later) and/or a wireless network card. The ASRock B450M Pro4 is a popular budget one because it has 2 M.2 slots and 4 memory slots, and it's compatible with the latest Ryzen CPU's.\n\n\\-Processing power. I recommend the 3000 series AMD Ryzen CPU's if you're on a budget, because it's relatively easy to upgrade to the 5000 series down the line and you can wait for prices to normalize.\n\n\\-Quiet cooling. Get the biggest tower cooler and the quietest fans you can afford. My fans are spec'ed as running at 16 dB each, so 4 of them together run at around 22dB, which is essentially inaudible with the background noise level in my room (around 32 dB).\n\n\\-Dual channel or quad channel memory rated at 3200 mHz and latency around CL16. Quantity of memory isn't a huge deal, but populating all your memory slots is a good idea to reduce lag and latency. I started at 16gB and upgraded to 32gB to future-proof, if you're going orchestral then go up to 64 or even 128.\n\n\\-SSD, size and speed. Solid state storage is absolutely essential. It's gotten really cheap lately and is logarithmically faster than conventional spinning hard disks. I recommend at least a 512gB NVME SSD plugged into the aforementioned M.2 slot to hold your system and essential programs. 1tB would be even better. If you need additional storage a SATA 3 2.5 inch drive is a slightly slower, affordable option to hold project files and sample libraries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe not important things:\n\n\\-Graphics card. You basically only need a card that will let you see the images on your screen. If you're planning on running multiple monitors then multiple inputs is a consideration. If you plan on doing video editing as well then it's absolutely important, but then the rest of my recommendations would be different as well!\n\n\\-Case. Just make sure it holds all the pieces and doesn't rattle. I'd probably say you can just save the case from your previous machine. \n\n\\-Onboard sound card. You're definitely going to add an external interface, so onboard sound isn't a consideration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps!", "400-450$ perhaps. But in this market situation doesn't what AMD says, retailers are still gonna sell it for way high.", "My understanding of the Infinity fabric used by Ryzen is that the sweet spot is 3600 MHz. It's hard to get anything faster to work in a stable manner, and that speed is the maximum that allows the clocks for CPU and memory to be synchronized. I'd get the 3600 CL18 if the motherboard supported it.\n\nSome combinations of memory and board \\*might\\* allow overclocking but that's unlikely to happen if your board won't support 3600 MHz on four sticks, that indicates that 3600 on two sticks is very close to the edge.\n\nFor what it's worth, I have a R5 3600 with 32G at 3600 MHz CL16,  but my motherboard is different:\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Ensign\\_nemo/saved/#view=MKpQD3](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Ensign_nemo/saved/#view=MKpQD3)\n\nOne option is to buy two sticks of the same memory, and run it at a slower speed. You might be able to get a speed close to 3200 MHz doing that, but its a crapshoot, and you'll need to experiment a bit to see if it is stable.\n\nI also caution you that the QVLs for most motherboards are often months out of date, sometimes manufacturing processes improve and you can squeeze a bit more out of the hardware.\n\nThis page: [https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450%20Pro4/#MemoryMS](https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450%20Pro4/#MemoryMS) is the correct one for the Matisse family but only has three GSkill entries, that indicates that the data is not close to complete.\n\nThe chart at [https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450%20Pro4/#Specification](https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450%20Pro4/#Specification) shows that the Matisse family should support up to 2667 MHz for DR in four slots. Going with two DIMMs (DR in the chart) only boosts you to 3200 MHz.\n\nBTW, the memory that you gave is 32G 2400 MHz: [https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-32gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232550](https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-32gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232550)\n\nIs this what you intended to buy? If so, why not go up to 3200 MHz for two 16GB sticks?\n\nI'd just get two more 8GB sticks and run them at 2667 if you get a measly 533 MHz more if you use 2x16GB rather than 4x8GB. You might even be able to clock them a bit higher than 2667. Maybe.", "AMD GPU are excellent in performance and have great OC potential. If they can feed the supply demand it could hurt NVIDIA and I think this is the main zone where they make more to take the ground in budget zone.", "I mean, it's not as simple as \"no difference\". As things stand, AMD cpus have a significant advantage in multi-threaded workloads (obviously I am talking about high-end cpus here, but in terms of price to performance this holds true throughout the product range), and as of 5000 series (if you can find one) hold an advantage in single threaded workloads too.   \n\n\nSure, they run a tad hotter historically, but even that's not simple. For instance, the 3700x is a 65w cpu. 65w is 65w, no matter who makes it. It cannot produce more than 65w worth of heat. Ever. Many Intel CPUs actually run at higher TDPs, which means they will run hotter. The i7-10700K, a comparable unit to the 3700x, runs at a 125w TDP, meaning it can run more than twice as hot, and has similar or lower multi-threaded scores (and slightly higher single-threaded) than the 3700x. It's also far more expensive.   \n\n\nAs it stands, it is extraordinarily difficult to reccomend an Intel CPU. They are far more expensive, have the same or worse performance (especially multithreaded - useful for stuff like audio editing), and don't offer any other advantages to make up for their downsides. This will likely change with the 11th gen release later this year, but if you're building today, AMD every time.", "One day AMD will dominate what Intel used to do and PCMR will be angry at AMD and Intel will become the supportive PC Hardware.

The motherboard you had chosen was a micro atx so it would be compatible but since you were going will an atx mid tower might as well get a full atx tower. The graphics card you were using was just outdated and was overpriced. Right now is pretty much the absolute worse time to be building a pc as absolutely 0 GPUs are in stock and those who are are out of stock. I recommend waiting until the GTX 1660 ti is more available and grab it for around 350$. You can also look at the used market like eBay or Facebook. The case I chose is pretty much one of the most popular budget cases which is super easy to build in and really aesthetically pleasing , it comes with two fans and I added another one to the budget for better airflow. You had chosen 3000mhz ram but I really recommend at least 3200mhz for Ryzen as it\u2019s really its sweet spot. Another thing is I kept the 500gb of ssd storage as you had done but I really recommend spending an extra 50bucks for 1TB storage at least.

Sort of how older i5s get crushed by their i7 counterparts now that 4c/4t CPUs such as yours lack the threads.\n\nOf less importance and my opinion is that the 5800x, while amazing, is kind of in an odd spot. The 5600x is the best AMD CPU for gaming for the money right now. The 5800x is like $150 more and another $150 gets the 5900x which is 12c/24t. You might want to consider the 5900x if you're not considering the 5600x just for the value and what I would consider a future-proof CPU.\n\nLastly, Intel CPUs are readily available and perform the same as AMD.

Due to this fact it's relatively easy to implement support for AMD hardware into the Kernel by it's developers and maintainers.\n\nHardware support will be in the Kernel long before the respective hardware is released.\n\nThis is the only point where you might have to look into details when choosing the distribution for brand new released hardware. But that is a very rare case.\n\nHardware support in general is very good nowadays in Linux. Almost everything will work out of the box. \nThere are some Realtek WiFi cards that can cause trouble, but other than that, only super special new things might not work. And scanners are also often a pain in the a* under Linux.\n\nDespite all of what we said, you can always test hardware support by making yourself a bootable USB stick with your desired Linux distribution and boot into the live desktop environment.\n\nIf your hardware works there, it will also work after normal installation. If something doesn't work, try another distro.\n\nIntel support is also very good under Linux. Intel even maintains its own Linux distribution named [Clear Linux](https://clearlinux.org/), so there is contribution given.\n\nI have two systems: a Chuwi Larkbox Pro with an Intel Celeron J4125 and a Miniforum UM250 with an AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 2500U.\nBoth run perfectly fine.", "I am running Ubuntu 20.04 on AMD 4800U smoothly", "&gt;Are there any parts that I could upgrade that would make a big performance difference? Or any parts I can downgrade without a big hug in performance? I'm still undecided if I should go Intel or AMD, or if I need more CPU power. Please let me know your thoughts.\n\nThe best bit about a home server using home hardware, is that you can add ram, swap CPU's etc etc. without a system caring. You can 'try first'. In short though, nope it all looks acceptable.\n\n&gt;Do I even need a GPU on this server? What are some use cases besides transcoding?\n\nNo, and none. Your i3 already has integrated graphics anyway.\n\n&gt;I keep hearing that ECC memory is pretty important to server builds. Given that I already have non-ECC memory, do I need to buy some? Also, the memory is CL22... is that too slow?\n\nThis is a BIG topic. First, no, no ram is 'too slow' for a server with less than 100 users, it's just not. So don't worry.\n\nAs for ECC, here's the deal; It's job is to make sure the bits written to the RAM don't corrupt, before they're offloaded to the Hard Drive.\n\nWithout it, you have no reassurance that the data in RAM stayed 'pure'.\n\nFor backups, this can be a big deal. For Multimedia, usually not; since a single corrupted bit or two will be unnoticeable in most media files, but could corrupt your backup.\n\nThe trick to using desktop RAM, is to remember that microchips DO have little tiny physically moving parts (called gates), that flip between 1's and 0's. So you want to ensure these gates are switched with maximum confidence.\n\nAs such, normally you'd set a dram voltage, of 1 step higher than default (whatever your motherboard allows as the minimum voltage add), and then knock all your ram timings down by 1 step also; electricity does have a rise, fall, and settle time; so by slowing the whole thing down a bit, you ensure any gates that flip are 'fully closed' and any errant voltage has settled, before writing the next bit.\n\nIt's still not any sort of guarantee, it's just a level of nerd safeguard.\n\n&gt;How would I get a VPN (NordVPN) to work? From what I understand docker containers run one app at a time. So if I have a container for qBittorrent, could I have another VPN container that could connect to the qBittorrent container?\n\u200b\nNordVPN is a monster of a tool, the fact that they route their business clients THROUGH your connection results in some very strange network activity.\n\nRegardless though, if you've done your research and Nord is fit for purpose for you, then so be it.\n\nYes, there's a LOT of ways to get a VPN to work with certain tools, but the easiest mistake-proof, noob-friendly way, is to just spin up a light weight Virtual Machine on your server, and have that entire machine connect to the VPN, 24/7.\n\nBlock all ports except the VPN port, so there's no risk of data spill, and you're 'safe'.\n\n--- \n\nThe only other comment I have, is to look into SnapRaid, on Ubuntu Desktop; rather than UnRaid, if it's mostly media content.\n\nNot only is it a free solution, but it checksums your data, which UnRaid doesn't do.\n\nIf a file corrupts on UnRaid, plugins can tell you about it, but not actually do anything. It's YOUR job to go and replace your corrupted data from a known safe backup.\n\nSnapRaid has the down side, of being not real-time; it only updates its protection whenever you set (say, nightly), so your 'new data' can be vulnerable for a day. However, it can scan and repair corrupted files.\n\nIt's not ideal if you're running a business off a NAS or such, but if you're storing media, it's far more ideal.\n\nSomeone like LinusMediaGroup are big fans of unraid, because media can handle some corruption, they can 'fix it in post', and they have a full backup at all times; but even they have moved most of their systems to ZFS; they just tell you about it in server blogs, rather than in big grand videos like they did with the UnRaid series.\n\nHome users are usually WAY more lax about keeping perfect backups, and verifying their backups were correct, so keeping the data safe on disk *really* should be a priority.", "Do you like Semiconductors?

Used in conjunction with the 5600X, always worked with no issue. However, Ethernet on this board does not work. I\u2019ve always used it with a USB WiFi adapter which has been fine. When an Ethernet cable is plugged in, an orange status light appears on the port, but the adapter is not recognised at all by Windows. \n\nPrice: \u00a345 + Postage/fees if using PayPal (Price reflects non working Ethernet)\n\nItem 3: Corsair TX650M 80+ Gold PSU.

Pop is typically the best distro for having this work out of the box with minimal headache.\n\nIt is my understanding that AMD has AMD processor only or AMD processor with GPU built in. I have never seen a situation with AMD processor, Intel integrated and an Nvidia GPU.  That seems odd.   Reason being is the AMD built in GPU is fairly good for both low power and gaming tasks without having to jack with the switching mess.\n\nI could be completely wrong or maybe misunderstood the question....  Can you provide a link to the laptop?", "Thanks!

As a guy who made the jump to AMD, had to return my 5600x. During my troubleshooting, found out many, many people are having issues with Ryzen 5000 series. And also because AMD is hot right now, Intel CPU's have been going cheaper so better value and might also save you a headache.", "They've been announced per the other comment.\n\nThough, actually I think there's very valid reasons to go either way. The performance of AMD is only better in some cases due to the work Intel put in especially with certain workloads. Add to that PCIe gen 4 which helps if you do storage intensive and... You might as well toss a coin.\n\nAnd while we're at it, if you're going to go thicc, do it properly and get a T15G.\n\nI'm also fairly certain the T14 G2 has a non MX450 option if you do a custom build, but honestly you can just disable it and having a free graphics card isn't bad.

Pure greed. 0 reason to exclude the non-X version. Now I can already hear someone say this:\n  \n\n\n&gt;But then the 5600 would cannibalize the 5600X and nobody would buy the 5600X.\n\n  \n\n\nAnd to that I say: then AMD probably shouldn't make CPUs then if they're willing to make greed and profit dictate the future of their products.", "Maybe AMDs higher end CPUs are competitive, but the 5600X definitely doesn't feel that way. To be competitive it has to make one think long and hard about which one to go with and why. I just look at both AMD and Intel's current offerings and go \"seriously? Tf they're smoking?\"\n\n  \n\n\nIn all honestly, I'm just more pissed they intentionally cut the 5600 variant because they KNEW they can make more money forcing people to go with the \"cheapest\" option which is the 5600X for $299.", "For AMD systems the \u201cfastest\u201d memory may not be the best.

Unless Lenovo adds an external controller (highly unlikely), there won't be USB4/TB3 support either.\n\nI suppose you mean AV1 hardware decoder (not \"VP1\"). Everything indicates that there won't be support in Ryzen Pro, because these iGPUs are still Vega (and the VCN in Vega does not have that support). There is speculation that AMD could update just the decoding module (VCN) to feature the latest codecs (i.e., put the VCN 3.0 already featured in RDNA2 cards), but so far the non-Pro versions do not have an upgraded module (they are still VCN 2.x) so it's unlikely we'll get it in the Pro version.\n\nYou'll get (at least) HDMI 2.0.

If you have $50 more for the Ryzen 5800X, that would be my pick, but you don't.\n\nI found two excellent articles detailing the performance of AMD and Intel CPUs in Photoshop and Premier Pro: \n\nhttps://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Adobe-Photoshop-AMD-Ryzen-5000-Series-CPU-performance-1956/\n\nhttps://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Adobe-Premiere-Pro-AMD-Ryzen-5000-Series-CPU-Performance-1960/\n\nPhotoshop is a program that uses few cores, and mostly cares about 1 or 2 really fast cores. This is where AMD is currently ahead, with each core being faster than Intel's CPU cores. If you mostly do Photoshop, the 5600X is the pick.\n\nAs for Premier Pro, Premier Pro actually uses all of the CPU cores available, so number of cores matters a lot for this program. So if Premier Pro is a main focus for you, the 10700K is the pick.\n\nNow if you use both program equally, I think you need to step up to the max of your budget for an Intel i9-10850K. The 10850K is a 10900K with ever so slightly slower speeds (only .1 GHz). It balances the need for high single core speed in Photoshop, while having 10 cores to increase performance in Premier Pro. The processor is $410 USD right now, and it's price should drop since Intel is releasing it's 11th Gen CPUs at the end of the month.\n\nNow I said $50 more for the 5800X since the 5800X has greater single core performance while matching the 10900K in multiple CPU performance, even though the 5800X has 8 cores.", "As someone who's been running systems from both teams since the AMD FX days, and then onto Ryzen while also running the chronologically equivalent Intel rigs in parallel, I can say that AMD offering have improved considerably.\n\nWhat remains as a bit of an issue with AMD is RAM compatibility, but even this is mostly a non-issue.  What happens most often is that the generic XMP profile isn't stable, but a little time spent in BIOS tuning the RAM manually resolves things.\n\nThe other big difference is overclocking is very different with Ryzen.  It's not the simple matter of dialing in the clock, then upping Voltage to achieve stability.  Ryzens do a pretty good job of overclocking themselves, and because they're unable to hit the same clocks as Intel's chips, they can be a little *boring* to an overclocker.  Overclocking is still possible, but not to the exciting *high numbers* you can achieve with Intel.  Even so, the clocks are irrelevant now, due to AMD's excellent IPC.\n\nThat's just a very general compare and contrast of the two platforms.  Most of your Intel will translate well to building an AMD system, but just keep in mind RAM may give you a bit of a puzzle to solve, and that chasing high clock frequencies isn't quite as exciting with AMD as it is with Intel.\n\nCheers.", "You need to use DDU to delete your old drivers, also run it again to delete AMD drivers if your old one was nvidia.

Not everyone has jumped onto having a ryzen 3k or intel equivalent in performance yet (somewhere around i-7k or 8k generation) and may put the GPU into their older system. Although AMD's CPU market share is growing, intel's still has the lead primarily because people take long periods of time upgrading their CPU compared to their GPUs, which becomes a huge problem because usually new reviews use top end cpus to alleviate bottlenecks when in reality that's not the typical kind of setup one would see.", "I'd never do it on my laptop and my laptop is hot garbage (Dell G5 SE) but I know this is a huge thing for everyone due to the crazy temperatures these laptops can hit. For example out of the box my laptop used to hit 110C and Dell set 115C as the thermal trip limit even though AMD set 105C as the maximum operating temperature of the R54600H/R74800H. A lot of people don't know how to change thermal paste or are too scared so they disable boost.\n\nA lot of laptop manufacturers are installing inadequate heatsinks in these laptops and getting away with it just because AMD said the max operating temp is 105C.

You expect me to go broke to feed your fandom?", "Actually, it depends what you want out of it.\n\nIf you have a 3090 for gaming, the best AMD CPU might actually be the 5800x due to it only being 8 core (and therefore skipping the performance hit of having two core die chiplets).\n\nIf you have the 3090 for raw horsepower for non-gaming tasks, and you have non-gaming tasks that benefit from more cores, then the 5950x is probably the best bet.", "There are a lot of advantages to going Intel, particularly right now due to the performance gap between Intel and AMD, combined with the supply issues on the AMD side (due largely to TSMC being over-booked).\n\nIn short, Intel knows that it has a limited amount of time to exploit AMD\u2019s inability to meet the demand for its Zen 3 CPUs, so Intel has priced the 10th gen chips to be extremely attractive to buyers.\n\nThere\u2019s also the consumer education factor: A lot of people remember how absolutely dominant Intel was for over a decade, and don\u2019t know yet that the performance crown is now held by AMD.", "They are visible to all on the AMD website.", "The Intel price drop is probably because the Rocket Lake CPUs are imminent.

The former makes for an interesting period - those CPUs are made to be priced competitively, but with shortage of material/staff due to our global pandemic it should test their ability to funnel resources to right holes at the right time and making sure to keep their now expectant customer base happy.

Yes, Intel has had a bad two years, and yes there has been leadership changes. However, when we talk about moat, the fact *despite* a rough two years intel has not lost much of its value. It has superior financial strength, more cash than they know what to do with, and profit margins AMD and NVidia can only dream of right now. AMD and NVidia are in growth mode right now, its easy to see their stocks skyrocketing, but they don't have market cap anywhere close to Intel. You could see when people rotated out of stocks AMD and NVidia saw a stark decline, while Intel relatively stayed the same. This is the \"margin of safety\" concept people talk about. Intel has the lowest PE ratio out of the big chipmakers, and actually has consistently paid good dividends for over a decade. AMD does not have the financial stability to pay a dividend, they need to keep putting cash in the business to grow because if they don't hit growth numbers they have a lot of value at risk.   \n\n\nSure Intel is not a growth play, but it has plenty of moat.

I wish AMD let you go nuts, as far as speed, like you can on Intel.  \n\nAt this point, as far as AMD memory OC'ing, I just want to pull of a 2000 mhz infinity fabric.  I'm not sure if my x570 can handle it though (asus tuf gaming wifi).   I'll try and learn the AMD process a little better on here before fighting my 5900x build.\n\nThis guide is a great way to start. https://github.com/integralfx/MemTestHelper/blob/master/DDR4%20OC%20Guide.md  This along with googling overclocking ryzen ram will find you all sorts of guides.\n\nOn AMD, the only option is pretty much hit the infinity fabric and tighten your timings to get your latency down.

It makes more sense to release them on the lower end rather than the higher end.\n\nIn any case, the performance difference between 6 CUs and 8 CUs isn't that great. These APUs tend to be limited by RAM bandwidth, and budget builders aren't going to buy the fastest RAM. If someone is willing to spend enough on that, they will likely be willing to spend on a higher end APU.\n\nThat said, I do think that AMD could include more CUs in its entry level desktop APU. I imagine that the process is mature enough that chips with two defective CUs are rare, and if they exist they can go to mobile chips. So AMD could probably go with 7 CUs on the 5300G.

And I personally haven't used AMD cards in a while, so I don't really know how good their driver-fixing is nowadays.\n\nA quick search didn't bring up much, but this: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/k8rp9y/classic_wow_has_blue_tint_after_amd_radeon_r5/\nUnfortunately that's not much help, but if it's something known, it should be able to fix it. I would suggest a **clean!** install of your GPU driver first - if it's the same result, maybe rolling your drivers back to an earlier version might do the trick. To be honest; as long as not ABSOLUTELY necessary, updating GPU-driver isn't necessary. As long as your system runs without errors and solid performance for the games you're playing, there is no need to update (never change a running system) and new driver versions usually just come with stuff that is needed or advantageous for new game releases - usually the most demanding new games which are using new render-technology in their engines. If you don't play such games and your current driver-version works fine, there is basically not a single good reason to update them really.", "Also- Subor Z+ APU was done and working, but the company went bankrupt and nobody cared to pick up the APU. And that was a ready product, just like the OP asks for. Not crazy expensive to make either (standard GDDR5 memory). But when you do things like that- your product has to be basically a whole PC/console hybrid, not just an APU, as it would not work on standard motherboards. And it is usually cheaper to go with the standard CPUs and dGPUs, unless you plan to make millions of it (scale economy), and can also build a walled garden for selling software for more- like the gaming consoles. But that is now what AMD, or PC OEMs do.", "I am never buying any product that is related to AMD ever again", "Might do the clean install of GPU drivers.  \n\n\nI've already gone to the point of uninstalling the AMD Driver and returning it back to my previous version and the surprising thing is that it still persist and keeps the blue tint.  \n\n\nAlso sorry for the second picture's quality as my camera is shit. You are correct the UI tabs look unchanged but they're like inverted colors (They look blacker now)  \n\n\nI've already gone through the custom settings for Rimworld in the AMD Radeon Settings and the blue tint still persists... Turning off the Color Temperature setting didn't helped.  \n\n\nI've already ran out of options, But I'm still willing to find solutions for this thing to be fixed.", "Not only ryzen 5000 series \n\nAMD supports SAM with ryzen 3000 (not 3000G) and 5000 series", "This. Now that AMD has cleared this up and doesn't have an vague promises like \"support through 2020\" they have zero reason to bother with Zen 3+ support on 400-series motherboards.", "Nvidia's implementation currently has problems that are not present when using AMD graphics cards.  I would wait for them to fix it.", "Zen 3+ might only be made available on x500 series chipsets.\n\nIIRC the desktop roadmap back in the Zen 1 days didn't have Warhol appearing after Vermeer. AMD were kinda forced to keep a promise to support all AM4 socket boards with everything up to Vermeer by public pressure.\n\nWith Warhol coming after the fact, they might say \"well we only promised Zen 3 for all AM4 boards, we never mentioned a Zen 3+\".", "Great, someone who gets it.\n\nThats what I would like someone to make clear, either from AMD or Microsoft !", "Hm... it's unfortunately rather hard to guide someone remotely with anything besides 'standard' procedure - I can think of many small instances and places I would look myself if the same would happen on my machine - I would try tweaking all the small settings and things I can think of and I know won't make things worse - but that's a process based on much gut-feeling and experience from working with computers for nearly 30 years now...\n\nSo right now I can just give some keywords that come to my mind - maybe some will lead you in the right direction. Would be easier if I recently had used some AMD driver software lately myself, but the last time I did was 5 years or so ago, and then I even used inofficual drivers and no AMD software-suite.\n\nI remember at least reading about similar problems in regards with an Win10 update - but that was quite some time ago as well, not sure why this should be affecting you now. \n\nAnother place to look could be Windows specific settings - Win10 at least uses some of their own 'color correction' features and some of them tend to be implemented/activated with updates without the user ever really noticing. So you could browse through some Windows settings in regards to deisplay &amp; graphics.\n\nThere is also a possibility that it's hardware-related - it could just be your connector/cable to your screen. Usually this would affect your system globally and not just one application, but well - there have been stranger things happening with computers. So you could try re-connecting your screen, trying a second outlet of your GPU (if available) etc.\n\nOne other thing could be overlays - these modern GPU driver applications like to bring their own overlay-features with them, for recording/streaming and similar stuff - some of them use intrusive methods to ensure their functionality with all render-methods - so it could be that it's not your actual DRIVERS that are causing it, but the AMD-software using some new overlay routines that are incompatible with RW's Unity version. You said you rolled-back your driver, but didn't mention if this included the AMD software (Adrenalin, or how they call it nowaydays) - so this could be another thing to look into...\n\n...unless someone here knows better advice...", "Newer Windows versions run better with newer CPUs, even if the difference is minor bar niche use cases (where it can be bigger). So this is on MS here, but it is not a bug - this should happen.\n\nIn reality, your CPU is OCed and fairly highly at that. It just is not stable. No one at AMD or MS should even look into this unless its affecting stock settings.\n\nI recommend slightly tuning down the OC to see if its fine. But yeah -&gt; an OS that better uses CPU resources = more WHEA errors with a barely stable OC.", "Note that none of the HDMI/DVI/DisplayPort ports are going to do anything unless you have a \"G\" series AMD processor - 3400G, 2200G, etc etc. The non-G AMD CPU's do not have integrated graphics so cannot use the built-in video ports on the board.", "I see you but gonna go for AMD this time, and actually the CPU's where I'm ordering from aren't priced like that, the AMD one is a bit cheaper", "And also the Motherboards are slightly different, many more options when going with AMD.", "To clarify on the Rolled-back my driver  \n\n\nThe AMD Driver Update included two options (The most updated, and the most tested) and I picked the most updated. Then I thought maybe the most tested (The older one) might fix this and it still didn't removed the blue tint...  \n\n\nI've actually thought of a way to get rid of this and its to downgrade to the more older drivers manually and I'm trying it right now to see if it will work.  \n\n\nBeen trying to find for solutions for a day now. But thanks for your advice anyway.", "What's interesting is that, at least as far as MSI BIOS updates are concerned, the AGESA patch (a) in the 1.65b BIOS cured the WHEA problem for FCLK values over 1800. I don't know what the AGESA version is for that patch (1.2.0.0?)\n\nThat leads me to believe the problem lies with AMD's memory management microcode, and if so the \"fault\" would rest with AMD.", "I mean this is since November.

Not exactly stunning tbh", "MSI made a rather stupid promise that they'd support future AM4 CPUs on their early boards and that felt at the time like a big part of why AMD rode back on Zen 3 on 450/470. AMD were rather definitive at the time of the u-turn that the would be the last, absolutely the last, cross their hearts and hope to die but in the end they'll have to decide just how willing they are to throw MSI under the bus.\n\nThe public furore will undoubtedly be quieter this time round though.", "&gt; AMD were kinda forced to keep a promise to support all AM4 socket boards with everything up to Vermeer by public pressure.\n\nImo it wasn't because of public pressure but pressure from motherboard manufacturers due to risk of lawsuits. \n\nSince AMD wasn't clear enough beforehand motherboard manufacturers marketed their B450 and X470 256 Mb Flash ROM motherboards as Zen 3 compatible since they just assumed that the additional flash storage was enough.", "they went back on their decision because they have to bail out an important AIB - MSI.\n\nfor if they have not jumped the gun with their MAX series boards citing support for all future AM4 processors (on the X470 and B450), AMD would probably have maintained compatibility only for the 500 series chipsets.\n\nbut good for us consumers, that the life of 400 series, and in some cases, 300 series chipset motherboards is extended by having BIOS updates to support the new Zen3 processors.\n\nI hope Zen3+ gets the same treatment.\n\nP.S: i seriously hate MSI's UEFI UI.", "**AMD actually officially stated in advance that Zen3/5000 series is the last to be supported on 400 series chipsets.**\n\n&gt;This is the final pathway AMD can enable for 400 Series motherboards to  add new CPU support.

Si pod\u00e9s estirarte a memoria de 3200 o 3600 Mhz mejor, le sacas m\u00e1s jugo al procesador y la diferencia se nota.\n\n- Si solo vasa hacer motion graphics como lo m\u00e1s pesado, pod\u00e9s ir con una 1660. Por como est\u00e1 el precio hoy en d\u00eda, si necesit\u00e1s urgente una gpu, pod\u00e9s laburar con una 1650 de 4gb tranquilo hasta poder upgradear. Si es DDR6 mejor. Para workstation SIEMPRE gpus de nvidia. Los codecs de renderizado y otros que tienen mean a los de AMD.\n\n- Por el otro lado, si tu presupuesto est\u00e1 acotado, el Ryzen 9 3900x me parece un poco overkill para motion graphics. Con un 5 5600x o 7 3700x vas a volar. \n\n- Si vas a comprar un M2 te recomiendo que m\u00ednimo tenga 3000 Mb/s de lectura. Pod\u00e9s usar uno de 256 gb que no te va a cambiar mucho. El que yo estoy usando actualmente es el Xpg Gamix S11 Pro de 256gb. Es una bestia y es dentro de todo barato. \n\n- Fuente: componente PRINCIPAL de la Pc. En el que menos queres ratonear. De este va a depender la \"salud\" de tus componentes, y puede disminuir mucho la calidad de vida si usas una mala fuente. Para la build que necesitas, y teniendo en cuenta upgrades futuros, te recomiendo 600 watts como m\u00ednimo. El d\u00eda que quieras una buena gpu para renderizar, vas a necesitarlos. Pod\u00e9s safar con 500 pero no es lo recomendable. Y trat\u00e1 de que las certificaciones siempre sean 80+ bronze para arriba. NUNCA comprar gpu sin certificaci\u00f3n 80+. Y si la tiene pero es muy barata comparada a otras similares, desconfi\u00e1 igualmente.\n\n- Gabinete: \u00e9sto es m\u00e1s que nada gusto personal. Por lo general los gabinetes mid-tower son los m\u00e1s populares. Trat\u00e1 de comprar alguno con frente mallado ya que permite un muy buen flujo de aire y ten\u00e9 en cuenta que si compras un gabinete sin fans o con uno solo, ponerle 2 o 3 m\u00e1s, en argentina sale un huevo.

There were 6 screws mounting the fan setup that needed to be removed, and then each fan had 4 screws holding it to the heatsink.  \n\nThe only issue was that the metal tabs used to mount the cooler took up too much room to fit the A15s below the GPU, so I had to bend them up with some pliers to make room (similar to other builds I've seen with a deshrouded Asus Strix 3090). \n\nOnce the tabs were bent, the fans fit perfectly and one of the smaller tabs that I didn't have to bend rests on the fans frames, giving the GPU some nice support too. The fans are practically flush with the GPU, so the fit is near perfect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4ry15tzwuut61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfnpln32vut61.png?width=1361&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a78f62363e62472b663772e6534e5c59ab35d4f8\n\nI initially also had an NF-A9 as a front exhaust, but it created turbulence when running at the same time as the side exhaust NF-A12x15. Since the A12x15 can move more air, I decided to keep it and get rid of the front A9. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img n907s5n3vut61...*\n\nI used the stock cables that came with the Coolermaster PSU. They are rigid, so I had to \"pre-bend\" them before I put them into the case so they wouldn't be pushing against the second A15 or the top of the GPU. I put some grills on the top A12x25 and side A12x15 so the cables wouldn't hit the blades. To reach the power button when the case is fully assembled, I stick a long thin screw driver between the blades of the side exhaust A12x15. The joys of an SFF case lol. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img q2xzj2d5vut61...*\n\nBack view. The PSU gets fresh air from the side and exhausts to the top, which works out really well with the top exhaust configuration. \n\nIn order to fit the PSU and another A15 on the D15S, I mounted it in a \"half-cage\" configuration that's detailed in this other build: [https://imgur.com/gallery/yvA9C11](https://imgur.com/gallery/yvA9C11) \n\nSome 6-32 nuts from Home Depot/Lowes perfectly fit on some of the extra short screws that came with the case, which is how I fastened the cage to the case. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 5oj1ja2avut61...*\n\nFinished build. Didn't show it, but the commander pro is in the front of the case behind the front panel. I just used some double-sided tape to stick it on there and have all the fan cables running through the top and bottom outlets on the front. The front panel fits just fine with the commander pro behind it since its so thin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4h2tzwdvut61.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3316b84dfa998b743a85256b000fc53ee9565f8c\n\nRan a 1 hour long unnecessary OMEGA stress test consisting of all of the following running at the same time and monitoring with HWinfo: \n\n\\-A 4k Youtube video playing \n\n\\-Unigine Heaven 1440p highest settings \n\n\\-Unigine Superposition 8k highest settings \n\n\\-Aida64 stress test with ALL of the stress settings on (including the GPU and storage) \n\n\\-All stock hardware settings. No manual tweaking of the GPU, CPU, or RAM (aside from enabling DOCP in the BIOS for 3600 Mhz RAM and resizable bar for the GPU)  \n\nFPS for everything was of course garbage, but the main point was to make sure fans and PSU could keep up with the heat and power draw for an extremely unrealistic scenario so that there would be absolutely no worries while gaming. Here were the results: \n\n\\-CPU Max Temp: 79 C \n\n\\-GPU Max Temp: 75 C \n\n\\-GPU VRAM Max Temp: 92 C \n\n\\-Motherboard Max Temp: 46 C \n\nPretty happy with those aside from the VRAM, but thats a known general problem with all 3080s and 3090s regardless of case and coolers. Might replace the VRAM thermal pads eventually since thats been shown to lower temps by around 20 C, but its nothing worrying so I'll leave it for now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wants to do a similar build, here's how I'd recommend assembling it to save some headache: \n\n1. Mount the motherboard to the case \n\n2. Mount the PSU cage (not the PSU yet) \n\n3. Mount the 2 bottom intake A15s and run their cables through the bottom outlet behind the front panel \n\n4. Run the SATA power cable you'll need for the commander pro through bottom outlet behind the front panel (don't connect it to anything yet) \n\n5. Run the commander pro's USB cable through the bottom outlet behind the front panel (don't connect it to the motherboard yet) \n\n6. Mount the GPU, making sure the cables for the commander pro are going past and above it so they'll be able to reach the motherboard when its all connected (the GPU would've gotten in the way of the SATA power cable later, which is why we did it before this step) \n\n7. Attach all the cables you need to the PSU (including the main power cable) \n\n8. Mount the PSU to the cage, run your main power cable to the back of the case, and attach it with whatever option you purchased for the case \n\n9. Attach all your cables (for the PSU, commander pro, power button, etc) to the motherboard \n\n10. Outside of the case, mount the front pull A15 and rear push A12x15 on the D15S. You can't mount the middle A15 or else you wont be able to get to the screws, but there's an issue of the GPU not giving you ANY room to put a fan clip on the bottom of the D15S once its in the case. So here's what I did to fix that:    \n\n   A. Put the bottom fan clip for the middle A15 on the D15S and use a rubber band to hold it in place.   \n   Make sure you'll be able to easily remove the rubberband once the D15S is mounted!    \n\n   B. Mount the D15S on the motherboard    \n\n   C. The bottom fan clip will now be held in place by the GPU, so you can remove the rubber band.    \n\n   D. Put the middle A15 in and use some needle nose pliers or long scissors to pull the inside bottom   \n   fan clip (the one closer to the motherboard) into the clip hole on the A15. Then attach the outside   \n   clip too (you'll be able to reach this one normally)    \n\n   E. Attach the top fan clip to the A15 and D15S \n\n11. Run all the D15S' fan cables along the top of the case through the top outlet behind the front panel (around the power button cables) \n\n12. Slide in and mount the top A12x15 and run its cable along the top of the case through the top outlet behind the front panel \n\n13. Mount the top A12x25 and run its cable along the top of the case through the top outlet behind the front panel \n\n14. Attach your cables to the GPU \n\n15. Mount the side A12x15 and run its cable through the bottom or top outlet behind the front panel \n\n16. Attach the commander pro to the front of the case and plug in all the cables", "Maybe someone could give another perspective, but in my experience I completely disagree.\n\n Nvidia still has the best *overall* GPUs in my opinion, but AMD is no joke.

As for your unexpected shutdowns, from my experience AMD processors handle thermal limits a little less gracefully than Intel's. Set-it-and-forget-it overclocking profiles occasionally just don't work whether due to thermal solutions or the silicon lottery. You did the right thing tweaking it down. Additionally if you are using quad channel RAM that might contribute to instability, especially if an overclock is just about stable in dual channel.

I made sure the plastic was off!

As for the quad channel RAM, this was happening before I went from 2 to 4 channels, so that does not seem to be the issue. I did however find that one XMP profile was disabled for gaming boost or whatever MSI calls it, and messing with it made the issue happen less often. \n\n2. Sounds good! They're pretty abundant at the Best Buy around here and similarly priced, so not a problem. One question in return, how do I set the primary SSD to run everything like games and applications?

After doing some stress tests on the CPU and GPU, CPU idles at 40-low 50s, GPU at low 50s. At 100% load on a stress test, CPU max was 71 C, GPU was 73. So I think that's good!

Sure, having more RAM will speed up in very special cases (like if you upgrade 1GB to 4GB). Normally what matters is not how much RAM you have. But rather how fast you can access the RAM. A 4GB DDR4 RAM is better than a 16GB RAM from 2001.\n\nBesides the fact that you really can't mix RAM types on most platforms (apart from 100 series Intel), I would much, much rather have 16GB RAM DDR, even if it's slower. If you have 4GB DDR4, but it hits the pagefile frequently, you will have worse performance than if you had 8GB DDR3 or DDR2.\n\n\n&gt;NO. DirectX is just Windows cute version of OpenGL. Running D3DX games can be fast. But you should always rely on OpenGL if you want the fastest speed (since D3DX sometimes resorts to software rendering *sometimes*).\n\nAbsolute nonsense. DirectX is COMPLETELY unrelated to OpenGL. OpenGL has been deprecated for a while now, and very frequently performs around the same or worse than DirectX or Vulkan. Even on nVidia GPUs, OpenGL performance is only higher than what AMD GPUs offer for openGL, and it'll still be beaten by newer APIs. In Linux, Wine and Proton have advanced enough that most people are fine running with DirectX.\n\n\n&gt;You should check that your graphics card is dedicated, if it is integrated your GTA 6 will run at 1 frame per year. Integrated graphic cards often rely on the motherboard RAM for operating. And thus consequently slower as they depend on an external device. Discrete graphic cards often come with their own RAM they can use faster.\n\n\n&gt;Integrated === Square in motherboard\n\n\n&gt;Discrete === You can unplug it from the PCI thingy.\n\n\nThis information is immensely outdated. For one, integrated graphics have come a long way from whatever your era of hardware is. (Q35 iGPU) Starting from Clarkdale, iGPUs are integrated into the CPU rather than being on the motherboard. As such, your method of differentiating isn't valid. Especially if the user has a laptop... by your definition, a mobile GTX 1060 would count as integrated because 99% of the time it cannot be unplugged.\n\n\n&gt;Old games are often left unoptimized and they are single core. Meaning they only use a CPU at a time. Your i9 has like 16 cores, but the game only uses 1; so consequently it's slower.\n\n\n&gt;Your graphics card should take care for most of the rendering, so this should be rare.\n\n\n&gt;If you ever encounter this, your best option is to reverse engineer the game or find a patch which makes it multithreaded.\n\nI am highly, highly, HIGHLY doubtful that a modern i9 or Ryzen 9 wouldn't be able to handle workloads that are single threaded from 2005. I imagine those workloads were made with 2005 CPUs in mind, and if those were able to handle it, a modern CPU would be nothing short of a miracle in comparison, even if it were a Ryzen 3 or i3. Both single core and multi core performance have made strides since that era. Hell, a Core 2 Duo was already a massive improvement. As for reverse engineering, uh... what?\n\n&gt;What is better, faster CPU or more RAM?\n\n\n&gt;Fast CPU.\n\nArguable. In some cases, you would benefit from more RAM, especially if you already have more than enough for the platform. Not to mention a Ryzen 9 5950x wouldn't fare very well with 4GB DDR4. In general, you want to make sure that you're not getting too much memory for the platform, and that some investments are not great as a faster CPU or more RAM wouldn't help much with performance, like an LGA775 machine with 8GB RAM vs 4GB.\n\n\nI appreciate the effort you put into your guide, but a lot of it really only applies to very old hardware, or specific use cases (Linux with Wine) and a lot of it is just flat out wrong.", "There are Add-in cards for Thunderbolt. However outside of Apple, Thunderbolt ecosystem is not that developed.

But there are some AMD motherboards with indirect Thunderbolt 3 support- basically, a TB3 header where you'll need to buy a TB3 card and have a cable connected. They did not have direct support- ie an I/O port. I guess this was the only way to have some form of TB3 support without Intel certification. Receptacles- Type C and the header- does not belong to Intel. But out of nowhere, there is one AMD motherboard that did have direct TB3 support, therefore it did get Intel certification:  X570 Phantom Gaming-ITX/TB3. In fact, many AMD motherboards with WiFi support use Intel WiFi+BT M.2 cards. But it is a different story with notebooks. And it's a lot of hope to see this happen based on 1 motherboard.   \n\n\nI am sure notebook manufacturers could talk to Intel.

After 2 months in AMD service they gave me money back", "AMD just makes the better CPUs at the moment, especially at the high end they're making Intel eat dirt. But that could also be advantageously to you, the current gen i7 and i9 might be embarrassments, but losing the high end actually forced Intel to compete in the lower segments harder. As a result, especially the 11th gen i5 lineup is quite good and priced very competitively. The i5 11600K is basically all you need for games at the moment, and cheaper than the 5600X. It's still less efficient, but the performance is similar. Both AMD and Intel will introduce a new Mainboard platform soon, so you're not missing out on a lot of potential upgrades on either side (or you could wait for the next gens if you are in no rush.)\nGenerally, it's pretty childish to buy a CPU because you like or dislike a brand. You're not supposed to be friends with your CPU, it's supposed to perform. AMD currently just has the better technology, and it's Intel that has been intentionally limiting hardware to sell more expensive one for years. For example, Intel has been preventing customers from using fast RAM on cheap boards just so they can sell more high-end boards, even though Ryzen, which doesn't have that limitation, shows that even in dirt cheap boards you can run pretty fast RAM. Not to forget that Intel also makes you pay up for overclockable CPUs, while all Ryzen CPUs are overclockable by default. It's stuff like that that would make me understand that people *don't* like Intel. But holding on to a brand just because it *used to be* better just makes no sense. I'm sure Intel will have a comeback soon-ish, at least I hope so, but right now, most of their products are jokes with technology from 2016 recycled for the 5th time.\n\nSo that's that, try not to be emotional or naive to marketing when picking hardware, check in benchmarks what is the best bang for the buck in your budget. Might be the i5-11600K, could also be a Ryzen. Get what's objectively the best and neither blindly follow the Ryzen hype nor the nostalgic Intel fanboys.\n\nBack to the main question.\nGenerally, neither CPU nor GPU preform worse depending on what brand they're paired with. They perform up to their performance. But there are cases where an AMD CPU+GPU combo can have better performance, mainly because of Smart Access Memory. It allows the GPU to share its fast memory with the CPU, based on the PCIe Rezisable BAR technology. Depending on the game, that can improve performance by up to 10%, but there are also games where it makes no difference at all. So I wouldn't put that feature too high on my list. Additionally, in my experience, AMD's GPU drivers still kinda suck. Since I have Nvidia, my system is just running more stable than it ever did with AMD Radeon. Wouldn't trade that for 10% more performance. Who cares whether or not you have 5-10 more FPS when you get black screens or flickering from time to time. That's what my experience was with the Vega 64. Perhaps it has become better, but at least with the Radeon 5000 Series, I've still been seeing many complaints about the drivers.\n\nYou can keep SAM in the back of the head, as well as (personal opinion!)

Basically overclocking means increasing clockspeed, and that has no effects on the longevity of your processor or graphics card. What has an effect is power and voltage. \n\nThis is basically the amount of power and heat you put into your CPU/GPU and the cooling solution has to dissipate as well as voltage which is directly correlated to this (as more voltage means more power and heat and less voltage means less power and heat) but can also be bad in itself if given too much.\n\nOverclocking is possible on practically all Nvidia, AMD, and Intel consumer graphics cards.\n\nWhen it comes to CPUs, Intel CPUs marked with a \"K\" at the end of the processor name (I.E. Intel i9 9900K) for example are able to be overclocked, but most Intel desktop processors and practically all of their laptop CPUs doesn't have this and as such are not able to be overclocked.\n\nAll AMD desktop CPUs on the other hand are able to be overclocked compared to Intel, but just like Intel only specific (although much more) laptop processors are able to be overclocked.\n\n\n\nIf you're going to overclock your processor/graphics card (I don't know whether or not your processor is able to be overclocked since you didn't specify the model name) as you are inexperienced I would avoid increasing the voltage on your components. You also want to keep your temperature below 90C, and optimally below 80C (but not required) however the lower the temperature the better. \n\nIf you want to reduce the temperature and noise of your laptop and increase battery life, I would recommend undervolting your laptop components, this also prolongs the longevity of your laptop as reducing voltage means you're putting less stress on your components while also increasing performance. \n\nOtherwise you can also just increase the clockspeed of them. If you give them too much clockspeed or too little voltage your laptop may crash or start getting weird artifacts, but this is completely normal and when this happens you just restart the laptop and reduce the clockspeed/voltage back to a number that is stable and you are good to go.\n\nLong post I know, but I hope this helps and should explain the basics for you!", "&gt;made sure I am not overclocking\n\nAlso made sure your card is not factory overclocked?

Imagination refused to supply any driver except a 32-bit Windows driver, and Imagination dropped driver support of it as soon as possible.

All really depends on your total budget. If you want a mid range gaming PC I\u2019d recommend grabbing an i5-10600K or i5-11600K which easily outperforms the 8700K in single core performance and also uses currently available components (verse having to buy mainly used parts with an older generation CPU. For a high end gaming set up I\u2019d absolutely recommend grabbing AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen 7 5800x for the best possible FPS and also fantastic workstation performance given Intel\u2019s latest high end offerings have been extremely expensive, underwhelming, and are equivalent to space heaters :p\n\nJust quickly: I do recommend checking out AMD and not ruling it out entirely. I know in the past their CPU lineup hasn\u2019t always been so competitive, but since the release of the Ryzen CPU\u2019s this has changed entirely even pushing Intel to actually innovate instead of as you said maintaining the status quo. The first two Ryzen generations closed the gap between AMD and Intel with a focus on making high core count CPU\u2019s available to consumers at low costs and undercutting Intel\u2019s prices. The third generation brought in almost equal gaming performance to Intel\u2019s offering and helped push for PCIe Gen 4.0 to become the standard. The fourth generation (which is weirdly named the Ryzen 5000 series) smashed Intel in both workstation and gaming performance that even Intel 11th Gen offerings haven\u2019t beaten. \n\nFor solely gaming I wouldn\u2019t focus on a brand name with the volatility of the current PC market, and instead look for the cheapest price option for performance :D", "Try running the DX web updater and do a clean graphics driver install by removing it with DDU and then installing the latest stable version from AMD website.

This way companies made both products. \n\nWith RTX 30 - Nvidia made it too cheap: \n* A $500 card outperforms a $1,200 card. \n* A $175 3050 might compete with a $300 2060. \n\nBecause of this, companies discontinued the old products. \n\nNo one wants to make a $1,300 card and have to sell it for $450. \n\nNo one wants to make a $300 card and have to sell it for $150. \n\nRight now if they sell it they could sell it for even more - but once RTX 30 is in stock, they're totally screwed. \n\nIf Nvidia targeted the $700-$2000 range with the new products, and let the old products fill the $100-$600 range - we'd have way less shortage. \n\n____\n\nAMD unquestionably has the best CPUs - the Ryzen 5000 series is top notch. I personally use a 5900X, and I'm content with it. \n\nIf you have a big bakery that makes 50,000 loaves a day - they might make more profit by selling more product. \n\nIf you have a small bakery and they only have enough ovens to make 50 loaves a day - they make more money by charging more. \n\nIf each loaf costs $2 to make. \n\nAt $2.50 retail - that's 50\u00a2 profit. With 50 loaves that's $25 a day. \n\nAt $5 retail - that's $2.50 profit. If they sell 10 loaves, that's $25 a day. \n\nSo for the small bakery - selling 11 loaves at a high price is better than selling 50 loaves at a low price. \n\nAt the end of the day - most people buy the industrial bread. \n\nIntel is the big baker - they have a loaf/chip for the commoners. \n\nAMD is the artisan baker. Their bread is better - they make money by charging more. \n\nAMD doesn't want to waste money making cheap bread. When you can only make 50 loaves a day - they want to make expensive loaves. \n\nIn the US - good luck getting a 1600AF, 2200G, 2400G, 3000G, 3200G, 3400G, 3100, 3300x, or 3500.

But hopefully it will help someone out. \n\nThis is basically the workaround that AMD users have been using to speed up MKL on their devices (until Intel removed it recently).

The differences can be attributed to a few factors:\n\n * Some of the tasks are better suited for one CPU architecture over another (despite both AMD and intel using the same Intel x86 instruction set). \n * Under the hood, numpy uses this thing called LAPACK, which is a linear algebra package (which is used in pretty much all these tasks here). There are multiple implementations of LAPACK. Intel MKL and OpenBLAS are two of them (and are perhaps the most common). The differences between these implementations are basically that they do some tasks quickly and some tasks slower. So the speed depends on which one you're using.\n\nRegarding the second point, intel MKL, as stated in the name, is developed by intel. Intel being intel, decided that they were going to use the slow version of the code if it detects that you're on a non-intel machine. If it detects an intel machine, it will use the most optimized version, hence making it run faster on intel devices. \n\nAMD users either had to use the slow version of MKL, or use OpenBLAS instead. The problem is that OpenBLAS can be pretty slow on a lot of tasks too. \n\nRecently, intel claims to have \"fixed\" this for AMD users (which is only partially true).\n\nThere is some discussion about these online, but because most of the general public aren't coders (or don't suspect there to be a difference), it isn't talked about as much.

The ones where the name ends in 'X' do not have integrated graphics, so you need to buy a separate graphics card if you use them. Ones not ending in X (G, H, HS) have integrated GPUs. You'd probably want to get 'G' here since you're building a desktop machine.\n\nFor Intel it works much the same. Processors ending in 'X' do not have integrated graphics while ones not ending in 'X' (K, F, no letter) typically do.\n\nRelevant to your question is also what video codecs have hardware support. This is usually added on a generational basis, so you should check out what video codecs are supported natively for e.g. Ryzen 4 series, 5 series, 10th and 11th generation Intel etc.", "This is what I tried to stress about 2 weeks ago that went mostly two deaf ears that Shoe Bots had this tech all wrapped into specialized closed source code 3rd party apps (StellarAIO, Estock, etc) and have been using it to quickly buy up any stock that came available from all the online retailers that sale GPUs, because the online sites of today are not capable of fighting the hacking tools of today.  This has been going on in the GPU scene since NVIDIA launched in September off their website, then ultimately shutdown their store because they saw the issue and knew it was nothing they could do to address it and instead chose to offhand their FE cards via Best Buy.   The Shoe Bots then just spread to other online retailers including BB.  NewEgg, Amazon, B&amp;H, all the Digital River ran stores including AMD's, and have set up a full scalping underground market, of buying up the cards first through their API hacking bots then flipping them back to consumers.  This has been going on for nearly 7 months now.\n\nFor a great time the tech industry set silent, then starting flat out blaming the \"cryptocurrency miner boogyman\"  meanwhile Shoe Bot scalpers continued on draining e-retails of their GPU stock, so they could flip the cards through resale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe real fix for this would be to cut the cord of online retail, the channels being used right now is broken.   None of these companies put a good enough filter in place that would stop these high tech bots. I'll stress again, these are more than an automated bot that can automate clicks, these bots are literally hacking the stores sites, see inventory and instant add to cart and process out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust think how this GPU drought has largely been drawn out do to e-retailers, AMD/NVIDIA/AIBs' ambivalence to this issue.   Had these outlets simply copied Micro-Center's style, of sold in brick and mortars only, with limit 1 per customer,  most of the real people who wanted a new GPU since last fall would have likely got one by now.    Best Buy really upsets me because they have about 800 brick &amp; mortar stores and instead of mimicking Micro-Center they chose to do online only for GPUs and so most of their cards went right to Shoe-Bots to be flipped for resale profit.", "I was experimenting with this on my laptop just to see what Quicksync was capable of.

The streams were all transcoding at hundreds of frames per second.\n\nI can't say what the abilities of the AMD APUs are, but my Radeon RX550 card is basically a no go for transcoding as I run Jellyfin on my Debian server and Polaris cards have a serious performance issue in software when using VAAPI.

I'm more used to calling the such 'amalgamations', like [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html).\n\nSQLite is a database. It could be used as part of compilation, but a Unity file is just a giant file that optimizes translation units. It reduces parsing and compiling of header files, and reduces the overhead of generating large amounts of object files. Unity files don't scale poorly with multithreading. But, it still catches naming issues, and might provide optimizations.\n\nReally, to figure out what cpu you need for the best performance you need months of tuning and a ton of different computers to test how to optimize the build speed on different hardware setups.\n\n\\&gt;Also, you might be interested in [ccache](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ccache), which caches compiled code objects and references them instead of recompilation. Useful when only a few files are being edited.\n\nccahe is awesome. Again it depends on tuning. Usually it takes longer the first compile; but, all future compiles should be faster. Also depends on whether the project is coded to be able to take advantage of it fully. \n\nAll of this stuff is complicated, and AMD chips probably perform the best out of the box right now. Intel might win if you spend a lot of time playing around with settings. But, that might require tuning of how the system is setup, and usually just using the ck kernel gives the best speed performance with the least headaches.\n\nThe only problem with AMD is typically Intel has better compatibility with hardware for historical reasons.

Seeing the sun rise over the alps in MSFS in my hp reverb with high to ultra settings and still having an acceptable framerate was one of my best vr experiences ever.\n\nYou can say more often than not Nvidia works better in VR than AMD. A few exceptions here and there, but \"mixed\" has a good review of about 15 vr games.", "As expected 3090 is king, but I was wondering how it compared to say a 3070 or a 3080. In France these card are like unicorns, costing around 2 to 3 times the MSRP on Leboncoin (our Craigslist) whereas the 6900XT can bought quite regularly at MSRP on AMD's webshop.", "AMD's compatibility section is a joke and can be ignored completely. \n\nFrom telling people with a 6800XT that they should upgrade to a 5700XT, and all sorts of other stupid CPU and GPU \"upgrades\".\n\nIf your looking for what it can play, Youtube is about as best of a \"compatibility\" tool as you can get game + cpu = video.\n\nThough there's not a video on all games, bottom line is, don't trust AMD's \"compatibility\" \"tool\"", "To be honest there isn't really any good graphics cards that would fit your budget right now. You would have to play a waiting game most likely trying your luck of getting one. If prices weren't so bad I would've recommended a 3080 however any card of the 30 series really just happens to be way over budget including AMDs 6000 series", "They may.  I personally don't see the value in hedging your bets.  Make a decision and take as long as you need on that decision before you make it.  Even after you get whatever you get, you'll still be wondering if you made the right choice.\n\nLet's put it this way:  The difference between them will be mostly apparent in benchmarks.  A few milliseconds here or there, a few frames here or there, etc.  If it's between the 3070 and 3080 model, I can see waiting.  If it's not, just consider your use case:  Are you mostly gaming and browsing, or are you a content creator?  If it's just gaming and browsing, the Intel is more than fast enough, and sometimes faster.  If it's content creation the AMD spanks the Intel.\n\nFigure out your use case and make a choice.  If you're buying it with the idea you'll just return it if you change your mind, then don't buy it.", "It's so difficult to overcome the windows &amp; DX bloat vs coding to the metal for the Switch, that the Neo has to be much more beefy &amp; power hungry to compete. For a hand held, efficiency is king, and for gods sakes, AMD really needs to put RDNA2 in their APUs.\n\nVega is just so old &amp; obsolete in 2021!", "Competing with the switch one has to imagine x86 is a huge source of \"bloat\". When AMD has mobile parts in arm designs I could imagine something like a Linux spin from valve doing well of devs bite\n\nEither way it'll be an interesting shift if ms still wants to go down that route as well", "If you go to AMD website, Search for Driver Auto detect tool , it will scan your system and should download the correct drivers for windows 10", "Here is the PCPartPicker list for the link you provided.

Thank you for your help.", "Hey OP \u2014 Tech Support posts are only allowed in the [Q1'21 Tech Support Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/koajra/q121_tech_support_megathread/)\n\nYou may also wish to visit /r/AMDHelp and /r/TechSupport", "Not an expert by any means (almost completely an amateur but have been looking into this topic with a similar budget/goal), but my two cents\u2014it depends on the program she's using. Mostly commenting on the CPU/iGPU situation, can't comment on any parts other than that (though the PSU seems to be in the low priority section of the LTT PSU tier list, which could be a lack of info or observed problems, likely the former).\n\nWhile you may be able to look up benchmarks for the specific CPUs &amp; iGPUs for different programs, Photoshop for instance is primarily bottlenecked by the CPU in terms of general operations (with a few specific tools/exceptions iirc) and should be fine with both the CPUs listed. Some programs use more GPU than others though (have heard some integrate it heavily for some brush things), and if she wants to get into 3d modeling in the future then a GPU may matter a lot (except for heavy usage, you'd likely want a dedicated GPU anyway).\n\nThis said, the 3400g seems to be out of stock on PcPartPicker (in America, where I assume you are located) with significant scalping that bumps it up something like $100 from some retail options like Best Buy. That's a pretty significant uptick in cost. Also, having a better CPU could mean a better upgrade path when GPUs become accessible again in... 2022 or 2023. Personally, I might say 3400g if you can get one at msrp (can also downgrade the motherboard in that case if budget is a concern) but otherwise the 11600k seems decent in that it's not scalped and has arguably better long-term usability.\n\nA side note for budget, I suspect a cheaper motherboard would be serviceable, and some people might recommend a higher wattage on the PSU but according to calculators it'd probably be fine unless she's aiming to have something stronger than a 2060 in the future. Arguably worth it in the long run since a good PSU can last a long time, but also not a priority if she isn't thinking of that for a while.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIn my non-expert opinion, both are probably fine. Check the programs she uses and plans to use (maybe pop by their subreddits and ask about any bottlenecks) as there could be some variation there. Look into what she can actually get as well, since the 3400g is MIA atm, plus any sales (I'm not confident enough to recommend alternatives, but maybe someone else might be able to).\n\nEdit: if you trust Ali Express or Ebay, you can find the 4XXX AMD APUs, which have better processors (Zen2 vs Zen+) and more cores than the 3400g (depending on which APU) while having a worse iGPU for some reason (Vega 8?). This still beats out Intel's iGPU though. Late this year consumers will also get access to 5XXX APUs from AMD which will be on Zen3 I believe.\n\nHope that helped somewhat, saw 0 comments so figured it might be better than nothing.", "Thanks for the input, I did take a look at the 4350 which looks like it may outclass the 3400G. If I go AMD, I may go with that one. I am certainly not a fan of Intel, but the improved cpu of the 11600 is definitely compelling for longterm usage. I'll take another look at the PSU, I was hoping to snag a 3060ti, so I may need to upgrade.\n\nThe end goal of this is to have a pc that she can use to generate an income, so I want her to have professional capabilities with it.", "Pretty bullish on INTC, oil (RDS-B), and Japanese railways. \n\nI'm confident INTC will turn things around in the next 3 to 5 years. I think they've got quite a moat left and can't imagine they will go down without a fight. It wasn't long ago my colleagues at work were scoffing at my rig for having an AMD chip instead of Intel. Now it's the opposite, and ironically, I have an Intel chip in my current rig. Things change quickly in this industry.\n\nI love the idea of clean energy vehicles, but I try to be a realist. Despite the hype around clean energy tech and EVs, there lies a brutal gauntlet ahead for that market, between costs related to materials and R&amp;D, lack of widespread public infrastructure outside domestic cities, promotional hurdles and resisting sentiment (e.g., petrolheads will hardly let up driving gas-guzzling tankers like Caddies and Cudas), and the most important thing of all: The price tag. EVs are the future, but the market has priced in the future over ten years away. As much as I hate to say it, oil will probably be sticking around for at least another decade.\n\nThe Japanese rails thing is pretty much just a reopening play. People like to cite the work-from-home threat but these rails are used for a lot more than just commuting. People shop, have social lives, and travel.\n\nEverything else in my portfolio right now is basically a hold for me so while I *was* bullish on those, I'm more neutral now.", "Isn\u2019t the 1650ti better? Genuinely asking cause I have no idea about AMD mobile GPUs!\nEdit: NVM I just checked it out &amp; apparently the 5600M is at par with the 1660ti which is nearly at par with 2060MAXQ, making the 5600M at par with the 2060MAXQ", "I'm in the same boat, alot of my value plays have become slightly less desirable to keep buying, which is why I am trying to broaden out a bit into tech, as I actually saw some decent plays there. I do like the ev play, but stock wise it's extremely ridiculous and I don't see much money to be made. \n\nChevron and toyota have a solid new-ish deal with Chevron providing cleaner hydrogen for toyotas fuel cells and also investing in the infrastructure required for said fuel cells. I am a long term bull on green hydrogen, that being said, the only realistic stock for me to play this with is APD, everything else is un-investable right now. I did like Ballard power at sub $10. \n\nI chose to go safe with the ev market and I bought lithium mining stocks last year, particularly Livent and albemarle, but I have exited those positions since the prices they were at didn't make much sense, I had to take all my profits. I also invested in platinum/palladium mining companies (mainly sibanye-stillwater) because EVs and hybrids use a lot more of those platinum group metals than ICE cars. I figured that was the safest exposure to that bubble. \n\nA Japanese rail play is actually very out of the box and I respect that play. That's some shit that I would come up with haha. \n\nIntel is gonna take time, but I think Pat is good for it long term. And you're right, I used to hate on AMD and now all my buds hate me because I'm running an i9 instead of a AMD processor. I do hold AMD as well, but I think both companies will thrive and coexist well, especially if Intel's plans to get into the foundry business eleviate some of the data center market share risk. If anybody can pull it off, it'll be intel.

They don't fear a semiconductor shortage either.  Easy to root for too.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Let's start with two very important disclaimers:**\n\n* AMD doesn't manufacture their own chips.  Neither does Xilinx.  TSMC and Global Foundries do.\n* Just because you *feel* their product is better, doesn't mean it is *better* from a stock performance standpoint.  No fanboy behavior please.\n\nI am leading with this because it is so important for understanding the difference between liking AMD as a company versus liking them as a stock.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Long ago, in a Valley far far away...\n\n***The year is 1981.***\n\nIBM has created it's first PC and was looking to power it with the HOT SHIT of it's time - the Intel x86 processor.  There was a catch... IBM needed a 'second-source' manufacturer.  This is someone other than Intel who could produce the x86 chips in order to ensure that IBM would always have access.  When Intel scanned the horizon of other early semiconductor companies they went ahead and chose plucky little AMD.\n\nAt this time, you may have forgiven Intel for viewing AMD as their little brother.  They both came from Fairchild Semiconductor in the 60's with AMD's core group (Jerry Sanders +7) leaving less than two years after Noyce and Moore had left to start Intel.  AMD wasn't a competitor at the 'leading edge' of semiconductor design or production.  Remember this is an era when semiconductor companies manufactured their own chips.\n\nIntel had a dominant position in the microprocessor space.  They didn't fear AMD.  So they chose their little brother and signed the agreement which naturally included technology transfers and licensing deals.  With this 'training', AMD would learn a great deal about the ways of silicon.\n\n[Sorry AMD fans but in this analogy you are Whiny-Kin.](https://preview.redd.it/ee83p7ouisv61.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55b7d59ad9a7a518c29c4b13c1de395d4ab4a40f)\n\nOver the next 15 years AMD and Intel would battle over AMD's ability to utilize the x86 architecture taught to them by Intel.  Court cases lead to arbitration lead to more court cases.  This is one of the nastier corporate disagreements and I would rather focus on the outcome of their war because it says what you need to know about AMD.\n\n# AMD's DNA\n\nIntel's falling out with AMD forced **AMD to become great chip designers**.  Everything that comes after 1996 regarding AMD relates to them actively pursuing performance leadership in every category they compete in.   Note that performance leadership means the best performing... not necessarily the highest selling.\n\nThis means that from a corporate DNA standpoint... every decision AMD makes is to produce the 'best' in the future and to dominate the top end of their market.  AMD built upon the x86 architecture while also working with the new ARM architecture - so they could develop better performing chips.   AMD spun out their manufacturing footprint (creating Global Foundries) to focus more effort on developing better performance chips.   When it came time to move into GPUs AMD acquired ATI for 5B because they were already developing the best performing chips.\n\nAMD may enter a segment as a low cost 'value' option (akin to them being second-source manufacturers for others) but this was always to get their foot in the door before developing what would become the performance leader of that category.  When AMD says it's coming for your market... they aren't aiming for anything less than being the best.\n\nAnd why do they do this?  It's simple.\n\n[FUCK Intel](https://preview.redd.it/u110pdt03tv61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f70ac6a8f9b6e49cabfc591801600ae6033e75cf)\n\n***Now let's fast forward... the year is 2020.***\n\n# Exiting the Pandemic\n\nAMD has very cleanly organized itself into 2 segments.\n\n* **Computing and Graphics:** This segment includes their GPUs and CPUs.  Think PCs and laptops.\n* **Enterprise/Embedded/Semi-Custom:** This segment includes their Xbox/PS chips as well as their servers and datacenter chips.\n\nUsing their Q4 2020 results, AMD generates roughly **60%** of their revenue on their Computing/Graphics side with **40%** on the Enterprise Side.  While their C/G business may be where many of you reading this 'know' AMD from (RADEON GPUs or RYZEN CPUs), we need to focus on their 'smaller' side - Enterprise/Embedded/Semi-Custom (E/E/SC).\n\nAMD's E/E/SC segment is where AMD gets to pursue it's true passion: developing stupidly powerful chips while making Intel it's bitch.  This is the business segment that puts AMD chips inside the newest generation of consoles (both Xbox and PS), [supercomputers,](https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/02/09/amd-takes-down-another-supercomputer-deal-in-europe/) servers, crypto mining rigs, and **datacenters** (remember this).\n\n[This is what happens when you can design beyond 10 nm](https://preview.redd.it/r3gnwlzy2nv61.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=384068deb5d4b882972ef2a07241551ba55422df)\n\nComing into 2021, AMD has a well stocked product portfolio with popular performance leaders across several categories.  They even felt confident enough to approach Xilinx for a merger (not going to cover this acquisition here).\n\n# Dude... where's your datacenter customers?\n\nLast week Intel released their Q1 2021 quarterly results.  They beat both revenue and earnings estimates.  Let's see if you spot the moment they released their results by just looking at their stock price against AMD (in yellow):\n\n[FUUUUUUUUUU](https://preview.redd.it/uwczq30fetv61.jpg?width=967&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0483369d62df2b545fac0f5fa7f68d99c8fd79cc)\n\nWhat happened?  It's simple, Intel showed that they lost **20%** of their datacenter revenue.  While Intel CEO and well loved YOLO'er Pat Gelsinger tried to dance around the topic of the gaping hole where their remaining cash cow previously laid... the market was quick to figure it out.  Intel just got its ass kicked in the datacenter.\n\nThe only question was how bad was it?\n\n# AMD's BLOWOUT\n\nIt was bad.  The market was correct.  AMD had whipped Intel's ass.\n\nIn the datacenter, AMD doubled their revenue from a year ago.  They notched significant customer acquisitions like AWS, Oracle, and Microsoft... many of these being previously loyal Intel customers.\n\nOutside of their datacenter they notched revenue gains across all the lines of business along with increased margins due to a better product mix.\n\nHere is how AMD viewed their results:\n\n[Their prior quarter also had record revenue.](https://preview.redd.it/x0g3yvuyjtv61.jpg?width=981&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b745cad7dc76b3d43e2a8751fec81572013281)\n\nWhile the revenue and gross margin numbers are impressive; I want to focus on the bottom where AMD generated $832M in Free Cash Flow (FCF).  FCF for AMD is very nice because AMD is extremely low debt.  As of this quarter, they have 10x the amount of cash/cash equivalents than total debt (300M).  This much cash post-R&amp;D funding represents a lot of tendies AMD can serve to their shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.\n\n# Isn't there a semiconductor shortage?\n\nI believe that semiconductors are just kicking off their own commodity supercycle and this is independent of the existing semiconductor shortage, but I want to show how AMD is well positioned in both the near and far term with where the semiconductor industry is heading.\n\nIn the near term, AMD is not terribly impacted by the shortage because their chips are built on the more advanced processes (less than 10nm sorry Intel).  The chips that are in the most demand for the automotive and appliance industries tend to be the commodity chips built on the less advanced process nodes.  Also, due to their products having nice fat margins, AMD is able to pay more to get their chips moved to the front of line.\n\nIn the long term, I think ALL fabless chip producers are going to benefit from the supercycle as more production coming online means the costs associated with manufacturing should decrease.  As long as the chip designers can charge high prices to the end customer, this will only result in fatter margins and crispier tendies.\n\nIf you are already invested in AMD... you can stop reading here.  Nothing I say is going to change how you feel about them as I am sure you have appreciated their growth over the past few years.\n\n[Trends are soothing...](https://preview.redd.it/izkf13u7otv61.jpg?width=895&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d55d1edb44ae08c02054092567334d48bdbbeb3)\n\nFor everyone who is looking for a scenario to jump into AMD... allow me to present my BULLCASE.\n\n# BULLCASE on AMD: They kill off Intel Design\n\nIntel's YOLO is the idea that Intel will open up as a contract manufacturer for fabless chip designers (like AMD) to become a western version of TSMC.  What may not be apparent is what this actually does to Intel's chip design side of the house.\n\nIn order for Intel to effectively serve as an external foundry, they will have to invest an UNGODLY sum of money just on the manufacturing side.  They may be able to sign checks to ASML and skip a process node completely (just move to 5nm) but all of this represents capital that is not being deployed to design better chips for the datacenter or for the next generation of laptops.  Meanwhile demand for CPUs/GPUs is consistently increasing year over year - particularly along the leading edge of performance where AMD is known to rule.\n\nWhile Intel's production capabilities improve; their design side withers.  Starved of R&amp;D dollars and executive focus, Intel Design fails to keep up with both AMD and the newly merged Nvidia/ARM.\n\nAfter close to a decade of efforts,  Intel Foundry is finally confident about producing semiconductors beyond 10nm.  Is Intel Design ready to be their first customer?\n\nNothing would be more poetic for AMD to have Intel's first 5nm process used on AMD chips.\n\nPositions: none.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**References:**\n\n[DD - Intel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/mp2f3b/dd_semiconductors_intel_intc_the_280b_corporate/)\n\n[Q1 2021 Earnings AMD](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_ee24874d4888cc56b59891df4ac06e6f/amd/db/778/6634/file/AMD+Q1%2721+Financial+Results+Slides.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ------------------- \n\n **[TickerDatabase](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index) entries updated:**\n\n[INTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/INTC)\n\n[MSFT](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/MSFT)\n\n[NVDA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/NVDA)\n\n[ORCL](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/ORCL)\n\n[XLNX](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/XLNX)\n\n[AMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/AMD)\n\n[ASML](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/ASML)", "This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

Nvidia have similar Arm/Ampere SoCs. Intel will have functioning 7nm silicon at some point in the 20s. How hard would it be to apply a node shrink to 5nm and repurpose these as mobile/desktop processors?\n\nWindows can run on Arm as can Linux, what Apple did was to make migration from x86 to Arm easy for devs and more importantly nearly seamless for the user experience. \n\nThe fight is not Apple vs Windows but Arm vs x86_64 or more abstractly RISC vs CISC Apple were just the first to do an Arm based computer with desktop class performance well and in a way that doesn\u2019t feel restrictive like the Surface RT on WinRT. In part they were pushed toward this by years of Intel CPUs being stuck at 14nm, CPU quality control and supply constraint allowing the iPad Pro SoC to be ported to the Mac without any performance penalty while retaining the inherent power efficiency benefits of RISC.\n\nApple Silicon is not ready to replace the discrete GPUs in their 27\u201d and 16\u201d models.

I did this as the card would hit over 1000 FPS in some game menus and the coil whine was pretty loud when that happened", "NVIDIA has the best raw performance under proprietary drivers, however, there are some compositors (such as KWin on Plasma) that do not work properly with it and require you to do some fiddling. You may need to turn on Force Composition Pipeline in NVIDIA X Settings if you want to get rid of the tearing at cost of small stutters. Sometimes, the driver won't behave properly and glitch out some graphical stuff, such as the text glitching out on some games from time to time or Vulkan render being so screwed up in others. My point is, it can be a hassle and, since you are dependent on NVIDIA to fix them, it may take some time to, 1st get the driver into the beta and then some more time for it to be released as stable. Additional features, such as hardware acceleration for XWayland is missing, along with the 128 MB shader cache limit still being on, which depending on the game, it may cause it to stutter due to shaders being compiled unless you disable it with an environment variable. Also if you are on Optimus supported laptop, any driver version older than 390.xx forces you to use a much older method of getting the PRIME support going which can be a PITA to set.\n\nTo me, the biggest difference is just how little I even need to think about drivers with my AMD card. Plug, play, and never worry about it anymore. It just feels like a completely natural part of my Linux system.

I need to mess around with kernel parameters to get tty to work properly. I also see various weird graphical artifacts in my window manager every now and then with Nvidia cards.
