Sorry for the ramblings below - it's still early and I need more coffee:\n\nI like both ARM and NVDA but the two of them being in one company hampers ARM's core strength: They're a design house, not an SOC vendor. There are a lot of ARM vendors out there precisely because of that - they don't have to approach ARM as a potential competitor that they need to do business with. They know their business interests are aligned.\n\nNVDA buying ARM changes this dynamic. Sure, the regulators will ask NVDA to put all kinds of firewalls around ARM not to affect other ARM vendors. But even that won't be enough IMO.\n\nMeanwhile, if NVDA wants to utilize ARM's personnel to design their own SOCs (say, like Apple), well, that works well if you're not planning to sell your chips (say, like Apple!) A marketable core needs to have the tradeoffs you need when you sell to multiple customers. So I don't see why NVDA would need direct access to ARM to design and sell a custom SOC or anything like that. Doesn't make much sense to me.\n\nMergers usually fail to realize the rosy projections.

Look at the revolutions these products went through to become cemented into our lives. Look at the markets these products opened up for us. \n\nNow, what current item is undergoing this type of revolution? You guessed it, you smooth brained criminal you, the Automobile. What was once dinosaur machinery unironically running on dead dinosaurs, is now making the revolution on the scale that computers and phones went through to become what they are today. \n\nAnd guess who created a business moat anticipating this move 10 years in advance? Guess who cemented their ISO SAFETY CERTIFIED AUTO OS into 175 million automobiles as of today, hint hint: it\u2019s the same company that\u2019s so criminally undervalued and just took on AWS as their partner to scale up their business for next phase of the turnaround: Revenue Growth. \n\nBlackberry.
