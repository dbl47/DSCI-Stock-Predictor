By putting powerful processing and storage closer to end users, it will deliver the ultra-low latency thekiller apps of today and tomorrow require.\"\n\n\"We see edge computing as one of the major evolutions in IT in the decade to come. By enabling low latency performance of less than 10 milliseconds (a blink of human eyes takes 300-400ms), it is not only a key foundation of a true 5G network, it is also cloud computing coming to your door. We are still in the nascent stages of what we expect will be a longterm transformation, with the economics and opportunities still waiting to be figured out.\"\n\n\"In this report, we provide our views on edge computing, and try to identify potential deployment models and routes to monetization. Our TMT research team provides comprehensive investment implications of edge computing in each of the subsectors.\"\n\n**\"Edge Computing: The Extension of the Cloud -** Currently, 90% of the data generated by enterprises is processed in centralized data centers. Edge computing means bringing computing and storage capacity closer to users so that the technologies of the future \u2013 cloud gaming, remote surgery, factory of the future autonomous vehicles \u2013 can operate at the ultra-low latency processing of 1-10ms that is required.\"\n\n\"Even today it is delivering real business value. For example, GE was able to improve production yield by 8% with reduced scrap costs by applying edge computing to detect and analyse failures in real-time in its capacitor fabrication process.\"\n\n\"In the long term, we see micro data centers emerging at the edge of the network, handling latency-sensitive workloads locally, while heavier computing and AI/ML model training willremain inside centralized, largescale cloud data centers.\"\n\n**\"The Inevitable Trend -** Delivering a low latency experience is crucial for cloud providers and network operators because it means unlocking new revenue streams and market opportunities, if they can deliver cloud services the \u201clast mile\u201d with low latency.\"\n\n\"We see different \u201cflavors\u201d of edge computing potentially being deployed, such as Multiaccess Edge Computing (MEC) for 5G mobile networks, with tower sites and central offices being converted into data centers, modular/micro data centers for enterprise, colocation, CDN or public cloud owned edge cloud. Increasingly cloud providers are working with carriers or colocation providers to put hardware equipment in those locations to serve users. We also see enterprises experimenting with modular, micro data centers in remote locations to solve latency problems in the manufacturing, energy, and healthcare verticals.\"\n\n**\"The Future with Edge Computing -** We expect edge computing to bring profound changes to the industry. The number of devices will increase, but on-device processing may not be as important. Edge infrastructure will be compact and modular, whitebox hardware (equipment directly made by contract manufacturers) will likely accelerate, cloud architecture will prevail at the edge, with increasing levels of virtualization. Networking requirements will also change towards better Wi-Fi, SD-WAN, load balancing, and security. Tower and data center operators should play a more critical role in the future.\"\n\n\"**Potential Market Opportunities -** Sizing a market that has not yet generated much revenue is difficult, but we see potentially \\~$20Bn in opportunities across hardware, software, and services that could be deployed at the edge by 2023. There could be significant upside to those numbers over the longer term as more applications are developed to take advantage of its ultra-low latency.\"\n\n\"We see several end markets being impacted by this trend.\n\n\u2022 **Communications Infrastructure** (covered by Tim Long and Simon Coles). We believe the tower, data center and fiber companies will be at the forefront of the edge computing revolution. We believe tower companies will be most instrumental over time, given the tens of thousands of sites they manage, and the tight integration with cloud and wireless service providers. We see data center providers being more active in managing all the data accumulated at the edge, while fiber and small cell participants will be more involved in 5G. Overall we view **AMT, SBAC, CCI, EQIX, DLR,** and **SWCH** as the biggest winners in the U.S. and Cellnex (**CLNX.MC**) and Inwit (**INWT.MI**) as the most direct beneficiaries in Europe.\n\n\u2022 **IT Hardware/Communications Equipment** (covered by Tim Long and Andrew Gardiner). The move to the cloud has been a negative for many of the traditional vendors providing server, storage and networking solutions. However, we believe the development of a smarter, more robust edge network could partially offset this trend. Those companies provide required bandwidth and applications solutions, and are likely to benefit even more. We see **CSCO, CIEN, FFIV** and **NOKIA.HE** as the biggest beneficiaries.\n\n\u2022 **Semiconductors** (covered by Blayne Curtis and Andrew Gardiner). The move to edge computing is a clear tailwind for semi names as it pulls compute power from a highly optimized data center and places it on the edge where utilization may not be as high. Additionally, it may drive future applications, which will further increase computing requirements. This would drive, at a minimum, an additional CPU sale (**INTC/AMD**) along with the associated memory (**MU**), and in instances where more AI or acceleration is needed, a GPU as well (**NVDA/AMD**). On the Optical side, this trend would be a tailwind for Telecom levered names as each new edge system would need connection to the core network. More dense computing should translate to more content for LITE, IIVI and IPHI as additional transceivers and ROADMs (reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers) are deployed to connect the network.\n\n\u2022 **Telecom Services** (covered by Kannan Venkateshwar, Simon Coles and Maurice Patrick). Telcos recognize the need for increased investment at the edge of their networks, in order to provide lower latency and improved video service via caching, for example. However, the move from recognition to actual spending is yet to gather pace. Many telcos are increasingly looking to convert their central offices into data centers and monetize real estate for edge computing. Within our EU Telco coverage, we believe Telecom Italia (**TLIT.MI**), Proximus (**PROX.BR**) and Vodafone (**VOD.L**) have been earlymovers and are well positioned. Within the U.S., **T** and **VZ** are actively building multiaccess edge computing capabilities and are working with cloud giants to unlock new revenue streams.\n\n\u2022 **Software** \u2013 Security/vertical applications (covered by Saket Kalia). In security, edge computing has three potential long term impacts: 1. more \u201cedges\u201d create more network segments, and potentially more firewall appliances (positive read-throughs for **CHKP, FTNT, PANW**); 2. with the proliferation of the devices, we think endpoint security could become more important (positive read-through for **CRWD**); and 3. edge could also pave the way for more security-as-a-service adoption/competition (positive read- through for **ZS**). Outside of security, we think edge computing can make trends like Industry 4.0 more of a reality, which would have positive implications for names like **PTC** which sell IoT and AR/VR software.\"\n\n\"Due to the shift to edge computing, BMC Software should experience higher usage of its software as computing &amp; storage requirements increase. CommScope should benefit from increased demand for cabling and network switching demand and remote mobile radios. Lumen Technologies (formerly CenturyLink) should benefit from increased connectivity from the edge to the cloud. Zayo may see gains from CRAN architectures and private mobile networks but may be challenged as facilities-based providers build out their own networks.\"\n\n[https://street-guru.com/](https://street-guru.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ermjgv0dm0s51.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e20e28027fc87a2425bb30d9a43c9a594448f45d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5b6nmp0dm0s51.png?width=601&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a553b6afdf62fd9c8da562c8856e7044edf25a1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzjnus0dm0s51.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95a5680453e42b8dcf1fed99872488d3209d64aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ims05t0dm0s51.png?width=594&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcfe6feabbc7a9c8eb1b2e063ba44308c127e6f9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z6iecu0dm0s51.png?width=604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56c754032b757178cc8ccdf9f04dd136d834105f"], "2020-10-10": ["**\\*\\*Scroll down to bottom for AMD and NVDA trading strategies during run-up to AMD 10/27 Big Navi Event and earnings (expected 11/3?)**\n\n*Can someone give me a tard count in the comments?*\n\nHopefully this post will convert some of you bears from your gay ways.\n\n**LET ME MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR YOU TARDS.**\n\nI know, my last AMD post didn't age well. Blah blah blah. Do you gay bears not realize that this is an earnings play. I thought we may break out of the handle a little early and didn't factor in a FREAKING RUMOR that AMD may offer Xilinx 20-30b so I didn't have that priced into the prediction (DUH).\n\nHere's a[ link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7wukl/amd_forecast_climbing_to_9440_on_or_before_1016/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). You tards are funny.\n\nQuick sidebar: \u201cXilinx tech is used in a wide range of applications like data centers, industrial equipment, and cars. Adding Xilinx would help AMD on its quest to continue chipping away at Intel's $79 billion in annual sales. Xilinx is also highly profitable, with a free-cash-flow profit margin of 34% over the last year to AMD's meager 8% margin, on revenue of $7.65 billion over the same time frame. With Xilinx in the mix, AMD could also significantly boost its bottom line and further its ability to invest in new research and development in the coming years.\u201d\n\nAren\u2019t Tesla and AMD developing autonomous driving chips?? Would this deal help move that along and help cement AMD into the industry?\n\n(Mother Sue loves R&amp;D. In February of 1995  IBM hired Su as a research staff member specializing in device physics,and she was appointed vice president of IBM's semiconductor research and development center.)\n\nThis is a long-term strategy for AMD if the deal gets done. My belief is that this deal will get done and long term, AMD will expand into other markets and take over. \n\nBack to business: So what happened today (10-9) ? \n\nMy tard mind thinks an insider probably had puts expiring today so rumor was leaked or Mother Su leaked it herself because she knows AMD is mooning (looking at you gay bears).\n\nHere's the link to the[ first AMD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j601cc/amd_84c_1030_bullish_forecast_for_earnings_run/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) where I drew the cup and handle so you know I'm not messing around.\n\nLISTEN UP. Don't mess with Mother Sue (She holds a PHD at MIT and has been in the industry since 1994.) She will crush gay bears. China is even using her blood as the vaccine for COVID.\n\nSo why did I make that STUPID prediction?\n\n1. I've been studying AMD the last 48 hours with about 5 hours of sleep and wanted to get something out there just in case it was going to break. I'm also 3 months into trading and still a complete noob (Like I said, I only see patterns)  (NightMan the PatternMan)\n2. If I was right = BIG BRAIN\n3. If I end up being wrong = Just another TARD like 99.9% of people on this sub.\n4. I could still be right = BIG BRAIN\n5. I'm playing 4D chess and am holding 94c and 84c exp 10/30 (may be a week early in my prediction of $94 by 10/16) AND I\u2019m going to hedge with NVDA...more on that later.\n\nSO WIN WIN Tards.\n\nLet me one up. If AMD breaks out of its pivot on monday it will CLOSE AROUND 88.87 by Wednesday, Oct. 14th.

Not nearly as many stocks gapping pre market as there has been lately. The market is getting overbought and a small pullback/consolidation would be nice because so many stocks are overbought and getting extended. AA kicks off earnings tomorrow night and in the following weeks we should see some decent opportunities as more and more companies report. I never hold through earnings, I trade the reactions. My thought process when trading a runaway market is to trade with the trend until the trend shows signs of reversing. Many times when the market is strong, stocks will make incredible moves to the upside and many times people won't enter because they think the market might pull back or they want to short and end up get burned. FSLY was an example of a very strong stock that printed a reversal pattern on the daily (Head &amp; Shoulders) but since the market was so strong, FSLY just resumed trend and is now back at all time highs, NET yesterday had another strong move,  These are examples of some strong plays and if the market stays this way, we will see some more. Solar stocks have also been on a massive run, all courtesy of the bull market. So although I believe the market could use a pull back, I'm not sure when we will get one so my outlook remains bullish but I stay vigilant when managing my positions in case in case they pull the rug out from underneath us.

The UK government is reportedly preparing to intervene and block the acquisition if necessary on the grounds that NVIDIA buying up Arm could not only endanger its citizens\u2019 jobs but also threaten the country\u2019s sovereignty over one of its very few technology champions.\n\nCambridge-based Arm, formerly ARM Holdings, was an independent company until it was acquired by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group just last 2016. Arm, the owner and designer of the world\u2019s most used processor technology for mobile and embedded computing, was able to retain its original business model and operations under SoftBank\u2019s ownership. There are, however, concerns that things might not be the same with NVIDIA holding the reins.\n\n[The UK is particularly concerned](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-8824785/UK-edges-closer-blocking-30bn-sale-UK-chip-maker-Arm-Nvidia.html) about the effects the acquisition would have on the country\u2019s economy and sovereignty. As a UK-based company, Arm is naturally one of the country\u2019s prized possessions and it won\u2019t simply allow it to be handed over without much scrutiny.\n\nNVIDIA, of course, has promised to keep the status quo as far as Arm\u2019s business model is concerned. It even committed to turning the UK into a global center for AI research and excellence which could help strengthen the country\u2019s economy and prestige. Some UK officials, however, are not buying it at face value.\n\nNVIDIA\u2019s acquisition of Arm could face similar scrutiny from other regulators in the US and EU as it would give NVIDIA a competitive edge over its rivals. The potential for taking advantage of that to the detriment of rivaling Arm customers is too great to ignore. The deal is valued at $40 billion or 30 billion GBP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\nWhat are your guys' thoughts on this.

I live in Canada where we take it from behind from our big banks, and the commissions on options plays would be through the roof. For anyone whose purely on this sub for YOLO options plays, loss porn, autistic memes or can\u2019t pass a 5th-grade literacy test, this post isn\u2019t for you.\nUnfortunately, this might just be the only sub on the internet that skews young enough and has enough risk tolerance to pull this off. For those of you who are in high school, university or college, coming from someone who has been in it for a few years now: Corporate life SUCKS ASS. This applies double for Boomer companies and industries. Be prepared for people to seriously underestimate you, pay you crumbs in comparison to what you\u2019re worth, deal with copious amounts of office politics, shitty bosses, a pathetic 2-3 weeks of vacation with minuscule raises and so much BULLSHIT. The worst part, however, has to be horrible co-workers, of which there are two types: \nBoomers who are only in their positions because they have been at the company FOREVER, have been grandfathered in to their roles and would not pass the initial screening if they had to re-apply today (don\u2019t even get me started on the hoops you have to jump through to get hired\u2026 unbelievable). Yet, somehow, they still have the entitlement that is only rivaled by military dependas, simply because of their seniority. You will hear ad nauseam about how they are struggling to save for retirement but will insist on buying a brand new car every few years and demanding that they go on vacation at least twice a year with their family, both on loan, of course.\nYour millennial co-worker who just cannot shut up about how woke she is. This is usually a white woman in her late 20s or 30s who wears clothes that really should be used as table cloths. She\u2019ll rave about how healthy her almond milk is that she uses for her fair-trade coffee, will refuse a sit-down desk, opting instead for a medicine ball or standing desk, and will make every office lunch a nightmare because she needs something on the menu that\u2019s both vegan and gluten-free. \n\nTrust me when I say this: it. sucks. ass. I love my job, but dealing with all the nonsense surrounding it has aged me about 15 years in 5. I am slowly turning into the shell of the man I once was and I\u2019ve seen what the end result is. Just take a look around you: your Dad, brothers, cousins, uncles, relatives, neighbours, co-workers, managers. Do they look happy to you? All chasing that coin. I propose another way\u2026 \n\nThe basic premise of this strategy is getting paid to take on MASSIVE amounts of risk. This is why this should only be done by someone in the early stages of their career with little to no responsibilities and has a large risk tolerance, hence why I\u2019m posting here. None of you smoothbrains better post this on r/investing, r/stocks, r/dividends and ESPECIALLY not on r/personalfinance or r/PersonalFinanceCanada. They might just spontaneously combust from reading about someone who has achieved a return a whole order of magnitude larger than theirs and I don\u2019t know any good lawyers. There are also only so many loss porn posts I can view here before your pathetic $5K losses don\u2019t get me even remotely aroused. It\u2019s all fun and games YOLO-ing on options, but please consider stamping out your investment strategy early on in your career to minimize the amount of time you have to waste working for someone else and kissing their ass. Fuck that.\n\nThanks to this strategy, my net-worth is now $xxx at xx, as the title says. I started off with $25K in May of 2020, which I earned from working during university, paid off $8K in student loans, and have since been adding about $1K-2K per month and will be retiring at xx. I effectively shortened a 40+ year career down to less than 10 and you can too. With all that out of the way, here\u2019s a step-by-step guide.\n\nFinding the right group of companies to invest in. The objective here is not to pick winners, but instead to eliminate losers. There is a big difference between the two and the latter is significantly easier to do consistently than the former. I may not know who will win out in the semiconductor space between Nvidia ($NVDA), AMD ($AMD) and Intel ($INTC) but what I do know is that they will more than likely outperform Pfizer ($PFE), which still has yet to hit its all-time high again of $49 in July of 2000, AT&amp;T ($T), which is now back at the $28 range, where it was during the Great Recession, and Wells Fargo ($WFC), which has been in a perpetual downtrend since January of 2018, -62% so far. I haven\u2019t even touched on energy companies ($XOM, $CHV) that have been in a decline since 2014. The problem is that because these companies were heavyweights at one point in time, they still occupy a large percentage of $SPY, which caps your gains at the knees.                      You might want to choose a certain sector (tech/consumer cyclicals), growth companies, momentum companies or even a sub-sector like e-commerce or FAANG. Anything that removes large swaths of the stock market that we can be almost certain will continue to underperform going forward.\nLEVERAGE, LEVERAGE, LEVERAGE. You didn\u2019t think I\u2019d actually have you invest in ETFs did you? No, no, no. We are investing in leveraged-ETFs. $TQQQ, $TECL, $FNGU, $SOXL. These seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to three times (3x) the daily performance of the underlying index. If we\u2019re so bullish on these companies, why the fuck wouldn\u2019t we add some leverage on that shit? We want to have an outsized return on the gain of the greatest American companies. I use $TQQQ as it has had the #1 best returns of any ETF listed on American exchanges over the past 10 years. It is also relatively \u201csafe\u201d since it is more diversified than $FNGU or $SOXL. \nHedging. I know, I know, very distasteful for r/WSB. Trust me when I say this though, you\u2019re gonna need it. Not only does it make the inevitable dips and crashes in the market a lot more tolerable, but when done correctly can even INCREASE your returns by rebalancing every quarter. My personal choice is to use $TMF, which applies 3x leverage to 20+ year US treasuries. Depending on your personal risk tolerance, you probably want to have about 10-50% in $TMF. \nMORE LEVERAGE. For those of us who are actually on the spectrum and need an additional adrenaline rush in their life, you may want to consider borrowing on margin to invest. Once I had secured a full-time job and guaranteed cashflow, I borrowed $25K from Interactive Brokers, at less than a 2% interest rate, boosting my principal nearly xx% at the time. I don\u2019t want to hear of any suicides, so PLEASE know your risk tolerance and play within it. I borrowed just enough that I could pay it back with one years worth of savings. \n\nFor those who are serious about investing using this strategy, you can find a complete essay on everything I know; how it works, why it works, why I think it will continue to work and my general philosophy, in the Google doc here. I wrote it in October of 2020, when I was just starting out on my journey. \n\nPut all that together and your money can grow very fast. Not quite as fast as options, but with so much less risk, allowing you to invest your entire portfolio in this strategy rather than only a small part on a single option. Sure you can get a ten bagger on an option, but if you only invested 10% of your portfolio, you haven\u2019t even doubled your total money. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of taking calculated risks when you are young to cut your working years in half or give you a jumpstart on a down payment. Even a few percentage points more in returns per year can lead to huge differences in portfolio values 10, 20 years down the line. For example, compare the returns of Vanguard\u2019s Total World Stock Index Fund ($VT) to the returns of the NASDAQ-100 ($QQQ) from 2010 - 2020. By the end of the decade, you would have had more than 4x the return in $ value by investing in $QQQ. In other words, even if you thought there was a SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT chance that the NASDAQ-100 would go to $0 by the next decade and a TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT chance that it will be a repeat of the last decade, it is still the objectively better investment than a GUARANTEED repeat return on $VT from an expected value perspective. If you are young, dumb and broke and have a risk-appetite, DON\u2019T BE A PUSSY. Take the calculated risk. I can\u2019t deal with all the miserable Boomers around me. Please don\u2019t end up like that if you can help it. \n\nThat is all kids, I sincerely wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and this rollercoaster of a ride that is life. For those of you who do decide to take the plunge, do tell me how it went in 5 or 10 years time, I\u2019m always open to DMs. Hopefully by then my NW will have increased to $10+million itself.\nPositions: $TQQQ/$TMF (70/30)\n\nOh, and if anyone from Wall Street or Bay Street is reading this.

The acquisition of ARM is baked into the price. This is expected to be heavily contested by China, the UK , and the US (Who already is looking at tech under a microscope).   \n\n\n2.) The \"Supercycle\" of new video cards is also baked in, but most retailers reporting inventory report receiving fewer than 20 units per week. The new cards on the onset had problems crashing, and the cards were software detuned in the following weeks. Also nvidia's board partners opted to use more expensive and reliable hardware to offset this problem, which may or may not erode part of the margin on these products. The in house fab cards already seem to have razor thin margins as the quality, materials, and manufacturing process by all accounts are expensive.  \n\n\n3.) Nvidia leaks showed their hand too soon. Teases of the new gen video cards with double the memory capacity and possibly a better (7nm vs 8nm) die process has myself and many that I know waiting until their release to buy into this generation. \"Why buy a 700 product when I know one 40% faster is coming out behind it for probably $800.  \n\n\n4.)  AMD  is catching up in this space, and will gain some market share this cycle. I can't forecast how much, but their new line of video cards while still a ways off of nvidia's prowess have gained some ground. AMD has successfully toppled intel's CPU dominance, and is targeting Nvidia's market now.  \n\n\n5.) Game delays such as cyberpunk 2077 will delay buyers of the new gen into next quarter.  \n\n\n6.) Most importantly, while most analysts are bullish about NVDA many value it in the $300-$350 range.  I know that this has been a less important factor in the past year. But the market shed a lot of weight this past week with big companies now trading at or under their avg analyst price target.   \n\n\nI'm no professional, this isn't financial advise and all purely opinion.

Stocks slid Friday, but technology, communications services, health care and discretionary stocks had the biggest gains for the week, after it appeared Democrat Joe Biden could be the next president but with a split Congress.\n*****\n&gt; The election was still unresolved heading into the weekend, but even if Biden is declared winner, close votes and lawsuits are likely to result in recounts. The Senate appeared to be in Republican hands, but the margin of control is likely to be tight, and runoff elections are required for two Senate seats in Georgia in early January.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the uncertainty is going to catch up the market on a short-term basis,\u201d said Leo Grohowski, BNY Mellon\u2019s Wealth Management chief investment officer. \u201cPerhaps next week could be a drifting lower kind of week.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Ahead of the election, the market had been betting on a \u201cblue wave,\u201d where Biden would take the White House and Democrats would get control of the Senate, giving them total control of Congress. But when it appeared the Senate would stay in Republican hands, stocks surged on the idea of gridlock, which would keep Biden from implementing tax increases and lots of new regulations.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, there has been a surge in daily new coronavirus cases to more than 122,000. Economists are concerned that the economic recovery could suffer as some states could restrict activities and consumers may pull back heading into the important holiday season.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed, in its post-meeting statement Thursday, repeated that the course of the virus could help determine the path of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; There are a few economic reports in the week ahead, including consumer price index inflation data Thursday and the producer price index Friday. More than a dozen Fed officials are on the speaking circuit, including Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who speaks Thursday on central banking at a European Central Bank forum.\n*****\n&gt; The earnings season is beginning to slow down, but there are still dozens of reports, including from McDonald\u2019s on Monday and Walt Disney, Applied Materials and Cisco on Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think next week is just setting up to be a breather. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out here,\u201d said Grohowski. \u201cThe equity market\u2019s reaction has been I think understandable and probably better than many might have expected.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said there may be uncertainty for awhile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking about is the Senate races. Part of the market reaction has been relying on this divided government.\u201d After the votes are all in or recounted, \u201ca sweep is unlikely but possible.\u201d\n*****\n&gt; \u201cI think the longer this stays uncertain and messy, the more the post-election bounce comes into question,\u201d he said.\n*****\n&gt; # Different than 2000\n&gt; It would not be unusual for the stock market to sell off before rallying into year end, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall does not expect the type of turbulence there was in 2000, when former Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush in a tight race that ultimately went to the Supreme Court.\n*****\n&gt; \u201cIn 2000, they were not expecting hanging chads. But they do expect a contested election this time. I think in many ways the market anticipated this,\u201d said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; But the market, after its election week surge, could pull back. \u201cHistorically, the market goes down in the month of November, after a Democratic victory,\u201d said Stovall. Since World War II, Democrats won the White House nine times, and the market fell an average of 0.5% in November in those years, compared to the average gain for all Novembers of 1.4%, he said.\n*****\n&gt; After those Democratic victories, stocks then rose 1.9% in December on average, more than the normal 1.5% gain for all Decembers.\n*****\n&gt; Strategists said they currently do not expect the kind of lockdowns that states ordered when the pandemic started to spread in March. But there could still be some impact that could be negative for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; Grohowski said he sees some signs of optimism for the market. Strong data, like third quarter GDP, October\u2019s drop in unemployment to 6.9%, and the better-than-expected earnings are all positives for the market.

Our analysis here is based on historical market performance during the most likely political alignments for next year. We ran these likely scenarios through the Almanac database software to create this graph.\n\n&gt; We are either going to have the fifth year of a two-term republican president or a first year of a new democratic presidency. It appears the democrats will hold the house and the republicans will hold the senate, but that is not a forgone conclusion either. So we also examined both presidential outcomes with a democratic, republican and split congress.\n\n&gt; Our study uses the S&amp;P 500 from 1949 to 2017. We start in 1949 because it is the first full 4-Year Presidential Stock Market Cycle since the end of WWII. The Twenty-Second Amendment that implemented presidential term limits for a max of two terms or eight years was ratified on February 27, 1951. Truman in 1949 was excluded as there was a no change of party in the White House. We gave Bush 41 the same treatment.\n\n&gt; Admittedly, there are limited data points; four each of fifth year republicans and first year democrats. Here\u2019s what we found. A change in party with a new, first year democratic president came with democratic control of Congress and significantly higher performance for the S&amp;P 500, averaging 10.6% with a median gain of 15.1% versus 7.0% for the average post-election year since 1949.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a89421df75f426e1b1ff90cb2c29cb90/b63e1cf962f89fdb-a3/s400x600/f9bde99a9e4ba83b0df266a8d3cc04cd732cc58f.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Fifth year republican presidents in 1957 (Eisenhower) and 1973 (Nixon) had to work with democratically controlled Congresses and the market suffered significant losses. The market did well in Reagan\u2019s fifth year with a split Congress \u2013 a testament to how \u201cThe Great Communicator\u201d was able to work across the aisle with then Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill. Even with republican control of Congress under Bush 43\u2019s fifth year, the market had a tough year with ongoing issues in Iraq, North Korea declaring it\u2019s a nuclear power and the most active and second costliest hurricane season on record.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Job Growth Continues as COVID-19 Cases Rise\n\n&gt; The US labor market shrugged off election uncertainty and continued to add jobs in October. Despite the waning effects of fiscal stimulus and rising COVID-19 cases, per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US economy added 638,000 jobs, ahead of Bloomberg survey estimates calling for 580,000. The headline number was depressed by a 268,000 drop in government employment, including 147,000 temporary census workers. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from 7.9% to 6.9% despite a rise in the labor force participation rate, a reversal of the dynamic we saw in September when unemployment fell while the labor force participation also declined.\n\n&gt; However, a troubling trend remains beneath the surface. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the number of long-term unemployed\u2014those out of work for 27 weeks or longer\u2014continues to rise as a share of the total unemployed:\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-11.6.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the labor market has continued to show improvement, there are still many people out there who are having a hard time getting back to work,\u201d noted LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cWith total jobs in the US around 10 million below pre-pandemic levels and rising COVID-19 cases, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement despite the declining unemployment rate.\u201d\n\n&gt; COVID-19 cases in the United States have reached record highs with a weekly trend growth rate above 20%, according to the COVID Tracking Project. As the weather cools and more activity shifts indoors, additional restrictions to limit the spread of the virus could slow the fragile labor market recovery.\n\n&gt; In particular, much of the private sector gains in this month\u2019s jobs report were in the services sector, where previous jobs reports had shown strength in goods-oriented industries. Many countries in Europe have reinstated restrictions or even gone as far as implementing new lockdowns. While we don\u2019t expect lockdowns in the United States like we saw in March, restrictions on activity could limit future job gains.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # One Sentiment Survey Soars While Another Sinks\n\n&gt; In an earlier post, we discussed how bullish sentiment in the AAII survey has been on the rise, but looking at another weekly sentiment survey from Investors Intelligence, the opposite is true. The percentage of respondents reporting as bullish fell sharply this week, 7 percentage points, down to 53.6%. While a majority are still optimistic and that reading is in the middle of its range, that was the largest weekly decline since a 7.4 percentage point decline to 41.7% in the first week of March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, the percentage of newsletter writers that are \"looking for a correction\" rose sharply to 25.8% this week following last week's over 5% decline for the S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Correction.png))**\n\n&gt; The Investors Intelligence survey has a long history dating back to 1963, and in all weeks in that time, only 5% (174 weeks) have seen bullish sentiment fall 5 percentage points or more while the percentage of respondents looking for a correction has risen at least 5 percentage points in the same week. In the chart below, we show the average performance of the S&amp;P 500 following these past occurrences when there has not been another in the prior 3 months. The S&amp;P 500 has frequently been higher over the following weeks and months, but there is a slight underperformance relative to all periods since 1963 when the survey begins.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-II-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2 Post-Election Charts You Need to See\n\n&gt; The election is over, but the questions are mounting. We don\u2019t know who will be the next president as of Wednesday morning, but we do know that stocks tend to do well the final two months of an election year. \u201cOnce the uncertainty is over, stocks tend to rally in November and December, with November the best month of the year during an election year,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cOf course, 2020 isn\u2019t like any other year, and we still could be a ways away from who the winner will be.\u201d\n\n&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day shows that the S&amp;P 500 Index tends to do very well the final two months of the year, especially during election years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The modern design of the S&amp;P 500 stock index was first launched in 1957. Performance back to 1928 incorporates the performance of predecessor index, the S&amp;P 90\n\n&gt; One of the big takeaways so far from Tuesday night is that the Senate likely will stay Republican, meaning we may have a divided Congress. The chances of higher taxes and more regulation likely took a hit under this scenario. This could be a nice tailwind for stocks, as the S&amp;P 500 historically has done quite well under a divided Congress, up more than 17% on average. Additionally, in years with a divided Congress, stocks have been higher the past 10 times, with 2020 potentially being the 11th in a row.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-2-11.4.20.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; This election is far from over, so stay tuned to LPL Research as we continue to monitor things!\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Emerging Markets Cheering a Potential Biden Win\n\n&gt; The US equity market has seen a massive rally in reaction to what is looking like a Biden victory over President Trump coupled with the Republican party maintianing its majority in the US Senate. None of these results are official at this point, so they are subject to change, but these are the most likely scenarios as of now. Outside of the US, emerging markets have also rallied. In just the last two days, the MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) has rallied 5% and broken above resistance to new 52-week highs. If for no other reason then Biden's campaign slogan isn't America First, the rationale behind the rally makes some sense.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-Now.png))**\n\n&gt; The reaction of EEM in the aftermath of this election is very much different from what happened in 2016. Heading into the 2016 election, EEM had been trending higher, but pulled back in the days leading up to the election and broke its uptrend that had been in place since earlier in the year. Again, Trump's America First approach was understandably viewed as a headwind to emerging market equities.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-labels.png))**\n\n&gt; While the initial reaction of EEM to Trump's election was negative, that weakness didn't last long. The chart below shows the performance of EEM in the two months before and one year after the 2016 election. The gray box represents the same period shown in the chart above. Within days after breaking its uptrend after the 2016 election, EEM bounced back, rallied to its 50-DMA, tested its November low, and then in the early days of 2017 it was off to the races as EEM. In fact, even accounting for the post-Election Day declines, one year after the 2016 election, EEM was up 25% which was actually more than the 21% return for the S&amp;P 500! The moral of the story here is that first reactions aren't always the right reactions, and as an investor it's not just imperative to know the environment you are operating in, but also when the tides are turning.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/110520-EEM-2016-2017.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Winners and Losers During Trump's Presidency\n\n&gt; With Election Day upon us, below we take a look at the biggest winners and losers across financial markets during the Trump Presidency from Election Day 2016 through today. First off, below is a chart of the market cap of the Russell 3,000 since Election Day 2000 which George W. Bush eventually won. The Russell 3,000 makes up more than 98% of the total US equity market cap, so it's a good gauge to use for measuring the overall change in market cap levels. The current market cap of the Russell 1000 is just north of $35 trillion, which is up $11.5 trillion since Election Day 2016. President Obama oversaw US market cap growth of $12.3 trillion over his two terms, while President Bush actually saw market cap decline by $4.1 trillion after his two terms.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/mktcap.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a look at the total return of various asset classes since Election Day 2016 using key ETFs listed on US exchanges. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up 70.6% since Trump was elected, while the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) more than doubled that at +144.3%. Of the broad index ETFs in the matrix, the Smallcap Value ETF (IJS) is up the least since Election Day 2016 at just +17.2%.\n\n&gt; Looking at US sector ETFs, the Energy sector (XLE) is a huge outlier with a decline of 48.3% since Trump was elected. Technology (XLK) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) are up the most with gains of 154% and 97%, respectively.\n\n&gt; Along with Energy stocks, the oil (USO) and natural gas (UNG) ETFs have been more than cut in half since 11/8/16, while gold (GLD) is up 47% and silver is up 29.5%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/assetclass1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Not every country has seen stock market gains since Trump was elected. As shown below, Mexico (EWW) is down 28.5%, Brazil (EWZ) is down 19.4%, Spain (EWP) is down 6.8%, and the UK (EWU) is just slightly in the red.\n\n&gt; The US (SPY) is up more than any other country with a gain of 70.6%, while China (ASHR) is up the second most at +51%. Whatever happened with the trade war certainly didn't hurt the US and China versus the rest of the world on a relative basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/countryreturns1103.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/sectors1103.png))**\n\n&gt; Within the Russell 1,000 in its current form, there are nine stocks that are up 1,000% or more since Election Day 2016, with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at the top with a gain of 8,590%. Trade Desk (TTD) is up the second most at +2,448%, followed by Novocure (NVCR), SolarEdge Tech (SEDG), and Quidel (QDEL). Square (SQ) ranks sixth with a gain of 1,203%. Other notables on the list of big winners since Trump was elected include Etsy (ETSY), Teladoc (TDOC), Tesla (TSLA), NVIDIA (NVDA), Atlassian (TEAM), Boston Beer (SAM), and Lululemon (LULU).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/best-since-2016.png))**\n\n&gt; In terms of market cap gains for individual stocks, the numbers below are quite eye-popping. Apple (AAPL) has gained the most in market cap since Trump was elected with an increase of $1.257 trillion! Amazingly, both Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have added more than $1 trillion in market cap as well. Prior to the last few years, no company was even close to having a $1 trillion market cap, but at this point, AAPL, AMZN, and MSFT have gained that much in the last four years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/capuse.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Piu5auo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/MDVAWXO.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Yme9cXS.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 11.9.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/a6Kp4iF.png))\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOR4bP6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday  11.10.20 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/TfDOPZJ.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 11.10.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OsrCLIc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7Ibl9s.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 11.11.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y4tBaZw.png))\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wVnvQZH.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 11.12.20 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9PnmIUs.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uoiA0Bw.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 11.13.20 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Plug Power, Inc. $18.86\n**Plug Power, Inc.

Company\u2019s products are beloved by all the losers in your life (i.e. your loser childhood friend who works at McDonald\u2019s and spends all their paycheck towards RH YOLO trades, weed, and video games).\n\nThis is the number one seller of high-performance computer memory, cases, power supplies, coolers and gaming keyboards as well as #2 in performance controllers and streaming gear. Per Andy Paul (CEO) in their most recent earnings call, he reported that most of their product lines maintain a top 3 US market share positions, with several number one positions according to data from NPD group.\n\n\n**So what? Why should I care?**\n\nListen you retard. When there\u2019s unexpected nudity during that HBO show that you watch on Sunday night, you say thank you. You don\u2019t stop and ask, \u201cMan, I thought this show was rated PG. Why is there nudity?\u201d Similarly, when someone tells you about a promising stock that is going to double, triple, and quadruple from the current price point, you fucking listen and continue to read the wisdom documented in this long ass fucking post.\n\nCorsair generates their revenue from two segments.\n\nSegment 1: Gamer/Creator Peripherals.\n\nFor you retards who can\u2019t understand big words like peripherals, this segment includes gaming keyboards, mice, controllers, headsets and other streaming equipment such as capture cards and microphones. And I am not talking about $10 mice or $20 keyboards that your broke ass buy at Staples. These are high margin, high end, top of the line gaming/computer peripherals used by those talent-less hacks streaming live on Twitch, YouTube, OnlyFans, etc for \u201cdonations\u201d. Today, 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming video content on streaming platforms for an average of almost 6 hours per week. There are over 6 million committed streamers in the world today who viewed over 12 billion streaming hours in 2019 alone.\n\nThe revenue in this segment spiked 129% YOY in the most recent quarter to $161.1 million. It made up for 35% of CRSR\u2019s total revenue. This is high fucking margin business, which means Corsair is a winner that rips off those losers mentioned above. Their gross margin was 37.1% in the most recent quarter.\n\nSegment 2: Gaming Components and Systems.\n\nThis segment includes sales of equipment such as computer cases, RAM, cooling solutions, power supply units and pre-built gaming PCs. You know those losers with a big ass gaming desktop PCs with \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc3b LED lights around the case? Those \ud83e\udd21 s spend shit load of money on these gaming systems because it makes them feel important when they play video games with other losers. The gross margin for this segment is 28%. Not too shabby.\n\nIn the most recent filing, their total revenue increased 60.7% YOY to $457.1 million and the gross margin jumped significantly. Adjusted operating income increased 194% to $61.4 mil.\n\n**Ok. So they rocked this quarter. But what about their future? What is their outlook?**\n\nWell you ungrateful greedy f*ck, CRSR is well positioned to benefit from long term growth trends in the gaming hardware market, making it an ideal play for retards like you who can only ask questions like, \u201cPS5 or the new XBOX? SNE or MSFT?\u201d. No you retard. Those stocks are not gaming pure plays, and they are not fucking cheap. Your broke ass can\u2019t afford them. \n\nCRSR can rely on the gamer and creator peripherals business to drive sustained growth in the future. Why? Because of the fast growing e-sports market. According to some smart ass industry experts, they estimate that the global e-sports market could clock a compound annual growth rate of over 24% thru 2027. That means, the demand for video game streaming equipment and other peripherals is expected to increase in the coming years, adding $2.8 billion worth of incremental revenue over the next four years in this market alone.\n\nCRSR reportedly has 18.3% of the peripherals market today and controls 41.9% of the PC components market. The entire PC gaming hardware market is expected to add $3.6 billion in incremental revenue this year, thanks to all the losers playing games at home due to COVID. The total market size for PC gaming hardware market today is $40 billion, of which 83% was spending from competitive and committed gamers. These are true retards who will spend between $1,000 to over $1,800 on gaming hardware and accessories. \n\n**But the stock ran up quite a bit. Should I wait will it drops?**\n\nThe stock is still cheap. Their POS (Price to Sales) ratio is 1.91. In comparison, Logitech\u2019s POS is at 4.3. Additionally, CRSR is currently priced at 80x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E ratio of 26. Both are favorable compared to their peers.\n\nBecause of COVID, upcoming holidays and other factors/trends that are favorable to Corsair (i.e. anticipated next generation gaming hardware/GPU to be launched by NVDA and AMD), CRSR is expected to generate full year revenue of $1.6 billion this year (which is 45% increase YOY)\n\n- Second Wave COVID: Will force consumers to stay at home and people will need other activities apart from binging Netflix.\n\n- Holiday Retail Sales Outlook is still positive. Gaming products will be boosted by Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas shopping.\n\n- People are upgrading their home PCs. As more people stay at home or work from home, more attention is being paid to the home PC and people are spending $ on upgrades.\n\nThey focus heavily on the higher end of the market, with product focus on performance and innovation. With gaming growing rapidly and big money flowing into this market, demand for performance is increasing. CRSR\u2019s products meet the expectation of what the gamers want (i.e. speed, precision, reliability, great processing power, etc)\n\nAlthough the competitive and committed gamers accounted for 83% of the $40 billion spend in the global market for PC and streaming gears in 2019, that only accounts for 18% of the worldwide total of 524 million PC gamers in 2019 with the remaining being casual gamers, who do not often rely on specialized high end gears yet. (Translation,there is untapped market of 82% among the 524 million PC gamers who have yet discovered the beauty of high end gaming stuff)\n\nIf the average spend of this group of gamers were to significantly move up going forward, then the market will also grow by multiples (for high end gaming stuff). \n\nThis stock is currently undervalued compared to its peers like Logitech and Razor. Not only that, the current P/E ratio of CRSR is roughly 3% below the overall P/E of NASDAQ. Additionally, looking at POS (Price to Sales) and MCS (Market Cap to Sales), CRSR is cheap by discount of 57% and 45% respectively to the NASDAQ. Sales are expected to grow next year by more than 30%.\n\n**Risks**\n\nF*ck risks. F*ck that mindset. This company is already profitable and prints money. If you retards can blindly throw money at losers like GME and NKLA, you can throw money at a company with actual sales, actual products and actual profits.\n\n**Price Target**\n\n$40+ per share by May 2021. You can play the call option or you can just buy the stock.\nEither way, it will get to $40 range and above once this stock\u2019s valuation catches up with the rest of the market.

We keep bounding off of that 50 day MA which is acting as near term support but we still aren't cracking through this descending trendline.  Broader market seems to be looking at a Flat opening as well so we aren't going to get any Vaccine juice.\n\nYesterday was broad market rise for the positive vaccine.  This is becoming familiar now where Monday there are big moves and then we spend the rest of the week reversing those movements.  So looking at last week as an example, today should be a pretty large red candle day for us.  The fact that it isn't means hopefully AMD isn't going to drop bc of vaccine and we are finding some support here.  But its still very very tenuous.\n\nMACD indicators are still positive and actually were opening up a bit yesterday.  But they could close with a flat/down day today.  RSI is almost completely flat with a slight little bump up yesterday.  We are firmly in no-man's land without any indication which way this is going to go.  Notice how low the IV is on the calls.  The market is really pricing in very little price movement until it can see some sort of confirmation/swing.\n\nNVDA earnings are tomorrow which might give us some share price movement.  NVDA has been moving the same flat as AMD for a while now but has been forming a bull flag.  So the hope is that a breakout there could move us higher on a sympathy trade that raises all Semi's together.  It's going to be our last chance to see demand data and we might be able to see if AMD truly has been competitive in the most recent weeks with new products against NVDA.\n\n[NVDA Chart](https://imgur.com/a/i2t3OsA)"], "2020-11-18": ["[Daily Chart](https://imgur.com/a/8nbPmQZ)\n\nOkay this is getting real old real fast.  AMD is on auto-pilot in this area.  Still flat.  Still no confirmation or no movement.  I really would like to see us break into that A channel by the end of day.  That would be a positive move for the stock and set us up for another chance at breaking out of this resistance levels we have seen at the $86 area.  \n\nAs always if we can break out of the resistance area then that B channel is the promised land for where we want to go.  If not and we continue to putter along this downward trendline then sell calls on weeklies for a little bit of premium to use on buying the next dip.  \n\nI am a little concerned that the RSI which has been pretty flat looks like it is starting a downward movement.  Usually it gets up to that 60 range before it starts to reject when you look at it historically.  So if AMD breaks down here, you could see that it could be an early signal of a weakening in share price.  That could mean that more short term pain is in store for everyone.  So this price range is doing nothing for us but having us stand around patiently waiting for confirmation.  \n\nAMD may be a victim of its own success a bit and at these levels, its a little more expensive for the younger millennial retail crowd to pile into.  But this move up on we are currently in on weakening volume definitely does not seem authentic.  Would like to see more buyers come into play here.\n\nTrades: I'm still in wait and see mode here.  NVDA earnings are today after hours and that bull flag I posted yesterday could potentially yield a breakout.  If NVDA breaks out hard and there is any mention of \"increased sales competition etc etc\" in their ER call then that could give this stock a big boost.  NVDA hasn't really had to look over its shoulder too much in recent years and AMD starting to challenge them in their dominating space of GPU's is definitely no man's land.  If NVDA has a bad quarter bc of sales issues, it could definitely take down AMD huge since they are major components of Semi-ETF's.

After moving about 10k I chose to invest 100 shares in SBUX, some shares of Intel (INTC) and 5 shares in Nvidia (NVDA).

And GLAD has proved helpful quite a bit as it does monthly dividends with a higher yield than SBUX which I think is slowly helping build my overall account value up and growing it altogether.\n\nOverall just happy to see that my last 2.5 months of decisions have lead me to this point....I'm also considering pulling out of PG soon because I'm feeling a bit thinned out/stretched thin with how much research I'm trying to do while keeping my job at the same time and it just's a lot to do.\n\nWhere I go for information/research:\n\n* Fidelity when I log in has news and articles,\n* [marketbeat.com](https://marketbeat.com)\n   * has a Headlines tab\n   * has a Social Media tab which has helped me a bit more than the Headlines tab\n* [marketwatch.com](https://marketwatch.com) but less now vs 8wks ago,\n* googling the ticker and looking at headlines and any different articles on the company,\n* in Fidelity Active Trader Pro I get this window with a look at the news/articles for the different companies I have positions in (but now I've hidden it)\n\nAnd that's it.

The emergence of PLUG and FCEL should be great indicators of the appetite for this sector. Electric energy is the basis for our technology-driven society and with all the blame for pollution landing on FF corps clean energy is the answer (Exxon used to be one of the most valuable companies pre2010 after all). \n\nSo what should you invest in? My argument is not NIO and Tesla. Wait what, that's heresy?! Steady now and hear me out. That's like the equivalent of buying a Ford or GM and subject to tastes, availability, competition, and functionality. I don't know if you've seen recent news on Ford or GM but they are going to bring the heat really soon to these only EV companies. Ford and GM will literally flood the market with availability and the mass production will be extremely difficult for these fresh companies to compete with. The legacy car companies will transform into tech companies with rivaling battery and AI tech. Arguably not as good for maybe a decade but they will throw enough money at the problem to make themselves competitive before 2025. \n\nSo Ford and GM calls then right? Well, I've made out well doing so but that's still a long value-driven play in my opinion. Not to mention all the boomers in these companies that pullout after pennies of profits and stupid amounts of volume makes it rather difficult to move the stocks in meaningful capacities when most make out better in NIO and Tesla. I'd recommend IDRV if you'd like complete exposure to the likes of Tesla, Nio, Ford, GM, and NVDA. But it's still not what the biggest boom in the room over the next 5 years.\n\nInvest in TAN, ICLN, and QCLN. ALL equally good and still undervalued. How are they undervalued after +100% gains since March lows. Well, that's because the true weaponize autist hasn't hit them yet. Who is this Max level autist? It's none other than the US Federal Reserve. I'm not guaranteeing the Green New Deal but you'd be a retard to not see the trend that's happening. A literal energy and power renaissance from FF to Renewables. Governments worldwide are banning non-EV car sales past 2030, pulling funding from gas and oil projects everywhere, banning single-use plastics, and removing the subsidies that are floating FF in the markets currently. Politicians aren't dumb and they follow the money as well and won't be receiving the same level of corrupt payments they have been when the petrodollar was king. Biden will make renewables into the new energy giants and absolutely ass blast the entire sector with a literal money cannon that will force profitability for all involved. So don't invest in just one company that gets a piece of the pie. Invest in the sector with the ICLN, QCLN, and TAN that get the whole pie! Well, the Senate won't let them do that. Mind you over 60% of Repubs are for renewables, and many of them are aware that their reelections could hinge on their decisions on this matter. The Dems literally only need to flip less than a hand full of them to get it done. Big banks are also front running and funding a ton of clean energy projects and stocks while refusing to fund FF anymore. Electricity is the currency, fuel, information, and fun of the future.

Four main points:\n\n1. The whole chip sector is exploding between the tech wave, 5g, cloud, etc (and even the beloved palantir needing chips as they grow like crazy). And MRVL is focused on 5g and cloud infrastructure specifically and kickin ass in these markets\n\n2. Within this sector, MRVL is a value play at 20x PE. That\u2019s compared to a company like Nvidia at 85 and AMD at 120! But they all 3 have comparable gross profit margins. This means that as things keep looking up this offers bigger growth potential than the big players\n\n3. MRVL price has been depressed because they made a huge acquisition in October of INPHI. This gives them huge further growth potential into their strengths of 5g and cloud.  And this merger is virtually guaranteed not at some level questionable like the ARM-NVDA deal. \n\nAND this makes them a great acquisition target for a big player cuz they have a ton of assets at a lowish price. \n\nHere\u2019s the MRVL CEO talking about the acquisition:\nMarvell Tech CEO on acquiring data center company Inphi, 5G growth\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/10/29/marvell-tech-ceo-on-acquiring-data-center-company-inphi-5g-growth.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message\n\n4. MRVL has huge institutional ownership (at 89%!) so if we do start to get some price movement the float is small enough that we could see a 10-20% move in share price fast as retail fomos in. Especially in the event of an acquisition.  Also this should reinforce that smart money sees this as a great play. \n\n\nWith earnings coming up on 12/3 I think we see a modest run into it and then a pop on earnings. Yes I said it a pop! Not a pull back like most other tech because this is the first time we hear all the details of this acquisition and it\u2019s potential huge value that MRVL hasn\u2019t run on. \n\nI\u2019m taking a short and long term position for lower risk. If we do get a good earnings run up I\u2019ll flip my short term calls into shares for the long term. \n\n100 12/11 46c\n50 1/21/22 50c \n\nTLDR: buy MRVL. You\u2019ll thank me later\n\n\nSide note: I\u2019m a big fan of the strategy of buying leaps then selling super otm weeklies against them and buying shares with that money to build a position for free essentially with the leaps as long term leverage. This is my plan for my MRVL leaps once earnings passes.

I won't be very aggressive today since it's Friday on a holiday week. I'll be patient and only take the best setups.

Rotation into growth tech-stocks continues to be the trend as FAANG stocks have under-performed for 3 months now. The market can move much higher once big tech like AAPL, AMZN, FB, NVDA, and MSFT decide to participate in this rally. Look at the consolidation in the AAPL and AMZN charts. 3 whole months of sideways movement. Pretty incredible to see tech leaders stalling out like this. In my opinion, AAPL will have catalysts from strong iPhone sales this holiday season. Stock is currently at $117 I believe can trade $150 by next year.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7aru7ozd12261.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aae9c3fac28a4d56834f41ffbfb03d324f75235\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9uu5opd12261.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e708a258e26c2297b968ea60730446df6409f84\n\n# Next Week\u2019s Outlook \n\nA couple earnings reports I\u2019ll be watching next week are: ZM (ZOOM), CRM (Salesforce), SNOW (Snowflake), and DOCU (Docusign). I\u2019ll even throw in KR (Kroger) and ULTA (Ulta Beauty) in there just to see the results. Earlier in lockdowns ULTA was one of the companies to cut their dividend early and close many stores. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5cx4rare12261.jpg?width=950&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcad1e57b3797169ee1a21f90ad9f462fdd4d5e2\n\nGenerally speaking markets tend to perform pretty well from Thanksgiving into the holiday season (rolls eyes at 2018). IMO I think we see markets move higher as the big tech regain their swag and bring the rest of the market up along with it. Volatility is already dropping quite a bit. VIX is at lows we haven\u2019t seen since earlier this year before the market crash. Calls are cheap, but will they get cheaper or will more Covid cases cause another spike in volatility? Will Donald do something that causes uncertainty in the markets? Nobody knows the answer to this, but I\u2019ve presented you with the information that we have and where the current trend is going.\n\n# Sentiment Report \n\nI had to stop browsing WallStreetBets for a few days. Almost every single ticker mentioned in the daily chat was about PLTR. Although it was quite amazing to see, it was too absurd for me. In the sentiment report I\u2019ll look at a few of the other top trending tickers from this week.\n\nSome of you may or may not have noticed, but I\u2019ve implemented a new feature to the [WallStreetBets Trends](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/wallstreetbets-trends) page that will now display comment volume trends updated every 30 mins throughout the day. This is great to find stocks that are trending. Click on a trending stock ticker to see what everyone is talking about or just hit the \u201cPlay\u201d button and listen to comments on your favorite stonks.\n\nThe comment volume trends is different from the \u201cGaining/Losing Hype\u201d section which tracks changes in the stocks with highest percent market share of comment volume and is more related to the overall percentage share of comments. The \u2018hype\u2019 is a good measurement to see macro changes in the WallStreetBets sub-reddit. Comment volume trends looks more micro and is very specific to the ticker. For example, if something is trending on comment volume, it could be that the chatter went from daily average of 9 comments to all of a sudden 150 comments, which would be running at 1,400% increase in volume. However, 150 comments isn\u2019t enough to get on the \u201chype\u201d board due to the high volume of comments of other tickers (currently PLTR/GME/TSLA/NIO/BABA/etc).\n\nComment Volume Trends = Micro level.\n\nGaining/Losing Hype = Macro level and the sub-reddit as a whole.\n\nI would probably prefer to look at the new \u2018Comment Volume Trends\u2019 at the micro level from here on to see quick changes in comment volume for a particular ticker, as well as why it's trending.\n\nSome of the tickers we\u2019ll look at in the sentiment report are: PLTR, CRSR, FSR, and FCEL.\n\n**PLTR - Palantir** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wy32tpih12261.png?width=1630&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9103f73463be26dc32c96f3105503a30aeef3de\n\nWhat PLTR has done to the sub-reddit is absolutely insane. At the peak sentiment on Friday 50% of every comment that mentions a ticker was mentioning PLTR. Comment volume was over 5,500 out of the daily volume of 45,000. Out of the 45,000 about 11,000 mention a ticker (roughly 25%) and half of those were about PLTR.\n\nYou can see WSB sentiment was gaining popularity as the stock went up and up. At the current levels they have become slightly more bearish, expecting some downside, but most are still loaded to the tits in call options. Next week will be interesting. Many WSBers will be going to Valhalla, or will see their 1,000% gains become 100% gains (still good).\n\n**CRSR - Corsair** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwtzky1i12261.png?width=1612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36b1a6bcfd6c3fb7f86531d43c3513e3e5895195\n\nCorsair gaming is another ticker that has gained popularity on the sub-reddit for not other reason than the fact that the stock price keeps going up. The stock has doubled in just about a month. We can see that on November 20 after a week-long steady climb in stock price WSB sentiment peaked at 3.5% comment volume, roughly 1,300 comments per day. Most traders got on board the call train and saw some magnificent gains only a couple days later after the stock price shot up another 15%.\n\n**FSR - Fisker** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvw88rki12261.png?width=1618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=619daec3996585e2fede1ee8cd7a414c9d21c576\n\nFSR, a ticker gaining popularity due to EV mania is also seeing a boost in sentiment volume as the stock price follows a trend closely with NIO and TSLA. This is another stock trading at 100% gain this month. I like the company, and if the product is good I can see this stock continuing to climb higher. Currently $22.\n\n**FCEL - FuelCell Energy** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tm8m355j12261.png?width=1626&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a386e313dedb3a8b8d313665a521e6ebe3a89b6\n\nThis ticker flies under the radar most of the time and only started gaining in popularity after the stock price went up 80% in a few days. You gotta give credit where credit is due, WallStreetBets users are bar-none the best at spotting a trend in stocks. Do they always get on the right side of the trade? No, but more often than not they are first adopters of the trend and the stock price climbs higher after the first one or two waves of users hop on bandwagon."], "2020-11-30": ["NGA +19.7% (Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp and The Lion Electric Company announce merger and commitments for $200 million in a PIPE; combined company expected to be listed on NYSE)\nINFO +5.3% (S&amp;P Global (SPGI) and IHS Markit (INFO) to merge in an all-stock transaction which values IHS Markit at an enterprise value of $44 billion)\nAEG +3% (divests its Central and Eastern European business to VIG for EUR830 mln)\nOther news:\n\nCAAS +30.5% (has shipped approximately 120,000 units from its portfolio of electric power steering products for use in Chinese electric vehicles during 2020)\nAUTL +15.4% (announces publication of new AUTO6 Phase 1 data in childhood neuroblastoma in Science Translational Medicine)\nMRNA +10.9% (announces primary efficacy analysis in Phase 3 COVE study for COVID-19 vaccine candidate and filing today with U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization; Vaccine efficacy against COVID-19 was 94.1%; also amends supply agreement with UK for additional two million doses of COVID-19 vaccine)\nVERI +5.6% (Veritone aiWARE now supports NVIDIA (NVDA) CUDA for GPU-based AI and machine learning)\nMCF +5.5% (Contango Oil &amp; Gas announces signing of agreement to acquire Oily, low decline assets in Big Horn, Permian, and Powder River Basins)\nOTIC +2.4% (provides update on OTIVIDEX and OTO-313 programs)\nPLUG +2.1% (to collaborate with Gaussin on hydrogen-powered transportation vehicles)\nSHOP +1.7% (reports Black Friday sales increased 75% yr/yr to $2.4 bln)\nAZN +1.7% (receives approval in Japan for Forxiga)\nBCRX +1.4% (Allergy publishes results from BioCryst's APeX-J trial of oral, once-daily Berotralstat for the Prevention of HAE Attacks)\nAPDN +1% (Applied DNA Sciences DNA, EvviVax, and GVS receive regulatory approval to conduct veterinary clinical trial for linear COVID-19 vaccine candidate)"], "2020-12-01": ["**Good morning, here's my gap watch list:**\n\n**Gap Ups:** ALT, APPS, BA, CAAS, EH, FEAC, GDX, LI, LU, MRNA, MU, NVAX, NVDA, PINS, PSTH, PYPL, SOLO, SPCE, TDAC, VXRT, WWR, XONE, XPEV\n\n**Gap Downs:** ZM, ELAN\n\n**Outlook/Game Plan:** SPY gapping up again after a sell off and recovery after the SPY tested the 9ema which I had mentioned yesterday should act as some sort of support.

At launch, Wayki-X supported trading of synths representing cryptocurrencies, global stock indices, and US stocks. It allowed for one-click investment in global high-quality target assets. With iterations, optimizations, and an increased number of trading pairs, Wayki-X provides users with secure financial services of higher quality. During December 23 through 30, WaykiChain holds The First Synths Trading Contest with prizes for all. Everyone\u2019s active participation is most welcome!\n\nA synth is a digital asset. Its price is anchored to the price of the actual asset. You can trade synths without the need to hold the respective actual asset. A smart contract executes the synth trades automatically. Synth trades have infinite depth and zero sliding point, are open and transparent. [Learn more](https://medium.com/@waykichainwicc/wayki-x-101-waykichain-decentralized-synthetic-asset-protocol-4954673b9ac6)\n\n \n\n**\\[Rules\\]**\n\nEligible participants: all WaykiTimes users\n\nTime: 12:00 PM on Dec 23, 2020\u201312:00 PM on Dec 30, 2020 (HKT)\n\n1. Tradeable products are limited to the listed synths;\n\n2. Rank corresponds to users\u2019 yield and updates every 4 hours;\n\n3. During the contest, data on participants\u2019 yield is collected.\n\nFormulas:\n\n(1) Yield = profit during the contest/capital during the contest \u00d7 100%;\n\n(2) Profit during the contest = the current synth price \u2014 (xUSD deposits during the contest \u2014 xUSD withdrawals during the contest) \u2014 synth value at the contest start;\n\n(3) Capital during the contest = synth value at the contest start + xUSD deposits during the contest\n\n**Note:** Synth value at the contest start is the total value of synth and xUSD holdings. The value of synth holdings is calculated by synth price at the contest start.\n\nA simple example for easier understanding of yield:\n\nAssume that the total initial value of synths in wallet address A is 100 xUSD at the contest start. It earned 30 xUSD by trading the xBTC synth (synth prices are in xUSD) and deposited 80 xUSD at 7:00 AM and withdrew 20 xUSD at 11:00 AM. The transaction fees aside, the relevant daily data is:\n\nCapital: 100 + 80 = 180 xUSD\n\nThat day\u2019s synth value: 100 + 30 + 80\u201320 = 190 xUSD (displayed in the wallet)\n\nProfit: 190 \u2014 (80\u201320) \u2014 100 = 30 xUSD\n\nYield: 30 \u00f7 180 \u00d7 100% = 16.67%\n\n4. The top 10 participants in the final ranking at 12:00 HKT on December 30 will get the corresponding rewards;\n\n5. The winners must qualify all of the following three requirements to get the rewards:\n\n1) buy amount not less than 100 xUSD;\n\n2) total trading volume not less than 300 xUSD;\n\n3) the number of traded synths not less than 3 and the total number of filled orders not less than 10.\n\n6.

What would you recommend for a 25 year long haul any why?  \n\n\nDividend stocks - you typical moderate conservative ticks  \nVTI, MCD, MMM, PEP, JPM, DLR, LOW, ADP, NEE, TGT\n\nLarge Cap hold onto stocks and invest monthly   \nAMZN, NVDA, SQ (believe SQ is a disruptive sector), MSFT, AMD, TSLA, GOOG/GOOGL\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my personal thought (based off fundamentals and not really analytical) these large caps will continue to grow and within 10/20 years all of their stock can possibly double or triple along with their market cap. Some analyst believe AMZN might be worth 5k - 10k a stock within 10 years. I know its more of a risk, but I feel with companies this innovative, the risk might not be that bad. Especially $NVDA and its AI research. That is a large market in the near future.   \n\n\nNow dividend stocks strat, I picked companies where they seem very constant uptrend in revenue, so I can get both, stock profit and of course dividend. the thing is, dividend combined with the amount of stocks invested can be a winner as well in the long run. MCD I dont think is going anywhere. And with less people cooking and eating out, MCD for sure will grow plus dividend.   \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts"], "2020-12-24": ["Hello everyone, this is my first post here. So, I hope I could find some help with this question I had. I am a 20 year old college student who's looking for a new job. I have never really worked before thanks to school and general busy-ness of classes, homework and on campus events in an organization I was previously involved with. Also, to many this would not matter but, I am going to put this in. I am blind and I use screen readers to allow me to work on devices such as computers and most other smart devices.\nFor these reasons and more, I have never had any jobs in my life. I was trying to get a part-time job as an assistive technology intern but, it did not work out because of Covid-19 and the shift towards virtual jobs. Which, like many people in my age group, I have no experience with.\nI was looking on sites like Linked-in, Indeed, and Handshake but, I have not found any good jobs that I would like to suit my schedule. A suitable schedule to me would probably be more work during the semester break and limited work during the actual semester since I am in college full time. I would also prefer something that I could do for the long run.\nI have looked at things like coding online but, I am still considering myself to be entry level. I move at a slower pace than my peers because of my blindness and the reliance of visuals with in coding. Note- (This does not I am not a good coder. It just means I learn things differently due to text to speech. And having to understand how to read code line for line, use a somewhat complex UI that is geared towards sighted individuals and also learning keyboard commands associated with some developer programs.)\n\nFor these reasons, I have thought about blogging on the web. Many instructors, friends and fellow classmates who have seen my writing have said that I am a pretty good writer. In my two and a half years of going to college, I have taken at least 4 writing courses including Technical Writing, Writing 1 and 2 as well as others. I have received A grades in all mentioned courses, with most instructors praising my work.\nI do consider myself to be good at writing creatively and organizationally. The only weakness I encounter in my writing is my grammar and spelling. To resolve this issue, I resort to things like spell checkers, proof-readings from my friends and peers or websites like Grammarly.com.\nFinally, my main question for you (Reddit) is. How do I get into blogging as a beginner? How could I start getting jobs or what is the best recommended way of getting jobs? Do you have any other jobs that you may want to recommend that are not blogging but, suit my needs virtually? Finally, what software do you recommend I use for blogging? I ask this because I have no experience blogging and want to go by this with the easiest method for a screen reader like NVDA or Voice Over.

The point of this is to understand how changes in fundamentals like earnings are effecting TSLA's share price as a profitable company vs an unprofitable company. We will also look at things like the split, battery day, and the sp500 inclusion. And finally, we will look at TSLA's business plans and growth potential.\n\nFair warning, I had to drink a wee bit too much to get myself to write this post. Im not proud of it (the post not the drinking), and I'll check for typos in the morning. I did intend to write a bull thesis DD too, but then this happened...\n\nLest start by accepting our own irrationality. The entire international car industry, not including TSLA, is worth just shy of $1T in market cap and resulted in about 11.67 million new cars being sold in the US this year alone and $2.3T in sales world wide (not counting q4, no numbers yet), TSLA is worth $600B and sold 317K cars and did only $28B in sales (not including q4, don't know those numbers yet). The entire solar panel industry is worth about $200B in September of 2020, installing solar panels on roughly 4 million homes in 2020, TSLA is worth $600B and has installed less than 400,000 roofs since they started in 2016 (not this year, but over the last four years). TSLA doesn't have the best batteries on the market anymore after QS made the first solid state battery, which Toyota immediately beat and will use in their own EVs (thats at least two companies with better battery tech). TSLA is one of numerous different AI firms and big tech companies making AI driven cars, and TSLA's tech is not the the best either, take a look at [ZOOX](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/amazons-self-driving-company-zoox-unveils-autonomous-robotaxi.html) for example - these aren't half functioning prototypes, these are real. TSLA makes its own chips for their self driving cars, but do you think NVDA makes better GPUs, or better AI vehicle chips? -[yes, NVDA is better](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/transportation/) and in fact every major auto manufacturer is using NVDA for their EV and AI vehicles. \n\nThere is nothing that TSLA does that makes them the best any more. TSLA is not the only game in town, and their competition is poised to dominate these markets. I'll give you an example of innovation that many of you are too young to remember - GM was the first auto manufacturer to make a production EV when they released the EV1 in the late 90s. Tom Hanks drove this car and raved about it on talk shows. GM's engineers created the first Li battery to power the EV1. GM happened to be 20 years ahead of their time and was crushed by oil lobbyists, and the only thing Elon has done is open the flood gates. What TSLA investors don't know is there is an entire industry of far superior electric vehicles and related tech that has simply been waiting for the market to approve of it's existence. And while TSLA is the one who has opened these flood gates, what they don't seem to understand is all the other manufactures that have waited for decades for this opportunity are about to take advanatge. \n\nThe facts are \n\n* TSLA does not have the best EV tech (EV list below)\n* TSLA does not have the best batteries\n* TSLA does not have the best cars (look at the EV list below)\n* TSLA does not have the best AI\n* TSLA does not have the best AI taxi\n* TSLA does have pretty awesome solar panels, but not for 30k a roof. I have been quoted for 10k to re do my roof with shingles and another 8k to install more solar than a TSLA roof would provide.\n* And yet TSLA is almost (only vehicles) worth more than all of these industries individually, and almost 40% of all these industries combined.\n* ....TSLA is over valued by a long shot.\n\nYou can speculate on future growth, bla bla bla -but all these asinine estimates for TSLA's value assume there is no competition and TSLA is the only game in town. Not true as I described above. In fact, checkout this EV google doc that has been floating around reddit the last few weeks:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sKMfBZNkHdvaVKmweuv3sD--CzfvImALJxGj2Xj7Ozw/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sKMfBZNkHdvaVKmweuv3sD--CzfvImALJxGj2Xj7Ozw/edit#gid=0)\n\nNotice this doesn't include [Toyota](https://electrek.co/2020/12/07/toyota-electric-suv-battery-electric-cars/), [GM](https://www.gm.com/electric-vehicles.html), Ford (who is a majority owner of [Rivian](https://rivian.com/)\\- look up these trucks, TSLA's cyber truck sucks in comparison), [Volkswagen](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/23/success/volkswagen-id-4-electric-suv-unveiled/index.html), [BMW](https://www.bmwusa.com/vehicles/bmwi.html), or any other major auto maker that has skin in the EV game. It is no longer true, nor appropriate, to look at TSLA as the future of all things EV and human evolution - there is a shit load of competition that completely kicks it's ass. \n\nI'll illustrate this with a picture. This is Rivian's fully electric SUV. This is not some fake NKLA shit, these are real and you can buy one. \n\n[https://rivian.com/r1s](https://rivian.com/r1s)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pnrewegy8861.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=217a7766a70f4aa60c0634e8e3f5bd6fa852d4cf\n\nAll the negativity aside, lets give TSLA some credit - they broke down the barriers and basically made the market for EV and AI automobiles. But as an investor, I need to make money and I need to be honest - which is TSLA is no longer the only game in town and there are people doing better. \n\nTSLA with a PE of 1273 is beyond ridiculous because there is no way they can meet this market cap even if they sell more cars, install more solar roofs, sell more batteries, sell more AI driving chips, and more AI taxis than any other manufacture in those respective industries. Based on their competition they will be lucky to be leaders in any of these industries, let alone all of them, and yet a $600B market cap mandates that they do exactly that. For example, FB is the next biggest company in the US by market cap compared to TSLA, and they did $70b in revenue and $18b in total earning in 2019, and they did $79b in revenue and $25.4B in earnings over the last four quarters, and they have a PE of 31; while TSLA has done $26B in revenue and $556M in earning over the last four quarters which are it's four most profitable quarters in the company's history, and four of five profitable quarters total.\n\nHopefully by now you can appreciate that we can no longer speculate on TSLA's potential because we have lots of other great companies who do what TSLA does and we can start to put a real value on TSLA's products. \n\nAs our ability to drive up TSLA's price purely on speculation and being the \"only ones\" to do what they do slowly dies, our focus will turn to fundamentals... which TSLA doesn't have as I indicated above. Reality is starting to set in. Now that TSLA is profitable, people will treat them as such and value them accordingly - it is already happening, I'll show you.\n\nTake a look TSLA's chart below. The black arrows indicate TSLA's earning. From left to right, the first two black arrows indicate the first two profitable quarters in TSLA's history, ever. The stock roared. But look at what happens after the third black arrow... it sells off for four days after delivering a record number of cars during the height of the fucking pandemic, and this is six weeks after the Feds turned on the printers and after the CARES act was passed too. People eventually speculate again and drive the price higher, until we get to their July earnings - the fourth black arrow. TSLA posts another great quarter by their standards and they sell off for over a month as a result until the split (announcement and day of indicated by red arrows) and battery day (green arrow) drive the price higher. Finally, in October, TSLA announced it's best quarter yet (300M earnings) and it sold off hard anyway - the fifth black arrow. Now the 5th black arrow is complicated by a greater market sell off, so this is a questionable sell off, but the pattern does appear to become more and more apparent as TSLA becomes more profitable. In defense of the legitimacy of the post earnings October sell off, notice that TSLA did not fully rebound until the sp500 announcement, which was well after the market came roaring back post election. Finally, TSLA's last run is due to the SP500 inclusion announcement, indicated by the purple arrow. The point of this exercise is to understand what is moving TSLA's price, and while earnings moved the price up the first two profitable quarters, TSLA sold off post earnings in the following three quarter, indicating TSLA's performance as a \"real\" company are not meeting the expectations of investors. What I find most concerning is the sell off post battery day. TSLA's tech is and potential is what everyone speculates on, and if the greatest battery they have ever produced that is supposed to power their vehicles in the years to come can't make the stock run post PR, I don't know what will. Of course the sp500 inclusion did, but thats because everyone knew ETFs would have to buy 40% of TSLA's float on December 18th, which they did at $695 a share the second before the market closed. Since then TSLA has been stagnant and moving sideways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA 1 day chart. Arrows indicating earning, split, battery day, and the sp500 inclusion.](https://preview.redd.it/vva9a4yx39861.png?width=1052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45722d970c53af9a6b159cfc62ef946ccef96a9e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTaking a closer look at TSLA's recent trend, you can see the price has been trading in a pretty steep channel, well above TSLA's already steep historical trend. The light blue arrow is December 18th, showing TSLA's ATH. What I want you to notice is the overall trend within the channel is in the shape of an ellipse, indicating the price is action is slowly falling away and the stock is getting ready to consolidate. What is most interesting to me is TSLA's earnings are scheduled to be on Jan 29th-Feb1st, which coincidentally marks the peak of the circle. Since TSLA's last earnings in October, they have increased in market cap by over 60%.\n\n[TSLA 1 day candles.](https://preview.redd.it/u29wmbw669861.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daba14552ef6a54b49f3a34d63ea88cced363496)\n\nIf investors sold off post earnings the last three times, in spite of TSLA posting increasing profits, what do you think will happen after TSLA has ran over 60% on nothing more than people wanting to take advanatge of institutions having to buy shares on a specific date? I would also like to add that TSLA not only had good earning the last three quarters, but they beat their estimates by a long shot and still sold off every time.\n\nWhat we know is TSLA doesn't have any new tech to speculate on, and what tech they did have to announce resulted in heaving selling post announcement (battery day). They can't post good enough earnings any more to keep the share the price up. The only two catalysts that have driven TSLA's price higher since it has been over a PE of 500 is the promise of selling shares to someone else for more  - the split and sp500 inclusion, both of which have strong historical precedent for pumping a stock's price making for easy profit. \n\nThere is nothing TSLA can do in the next five years to justify this valuation. It is literally not possible for them to make cars fast enough in the next few quarters to have an even more surprising surprise earnings to keep the share price up- if a 29% surprise last quarter can't move the price up, what has to happen to move the price up after a 60%+ run three months later and a PE of 1273? There is nothing that can happen exterior to the actual business of TSLA either, such as a split or another sp500 inclusion, to drive the price up since these just happened...\n\nSoooo that's it. I think TSLA is gonna go sideways into earnings, if not dive before then. I think they breakout of their current channel by the end of next week to the down side. And if TSLA hasn't dumped by earnings, aka if it follows the ellipse, I'm going to buy puts a couple days before earnings dated a couple months after earnings around the $500p price.\n\nThe risk here is it's TSLA and Elon. Shit happens for no apparent reason sometimes. Elon might say he will take TSLA private at $694.20 and the stock will rip back up, or he might post a \"fuck short sellers\" meme and the stock will rip back up.

Intel is having a stronger price action of late relative to competitors and IV in INTC should be higher than is currently priced. \n\nLast week I exposed my view that Intel is an undervalued company and a very attractive short/medium/long term investment. In the interest of brevity I will not reiterate those points (go to my profile if you wish to read my thesis). \n\nToday I simply want to point out a somewhat hidden but obvious attribute of INTC's short term option play.  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nINTC options 65$ strike expiring February 26th (1 week of gametime) are the move.

Given the current hype in the semiconductor industry (justified and for more than one reason), and given Intel's market performance of late in combination with the several catalysts, (which I outlined in my previous post) I find \"beating\" this option contract a more than 50% probability. \n\nTo illustrate the absolute value of INTC relative to its competitors I will take a target price of 67$ by Friday (2$ in the money) and my current position of 50 contracts. \n\nFor every dollar above 65$ my contracts are worth 5k$ so at 67$ they would be worth 10k$. Assuming Monday you are able to buy at its last sold price of 36$ per option contract it would cost you 36\\*50= 1800$. The ROI for this hypothetical play would be 555% (10,000/1,800) . To reach 67$ from the current price it would require a 6.24% increase in INTC stock price. \n\nReiterating, 3.08% up to be in the money and 6.24% up for ROI of 555%.\n\nNow I would like to show you the price/return potential for other companies in the space. \n\nFan favorite AMD closed trading at 89.48$ per share. Applying the same parameters to AMD a 3.08% increase in AMDs stock next week would bring it to 92.25$. Options for 92$ closed last price at 78$ per contract and options at 92.5 at 63$, average them both to get a fair value for what an option price at 92.25$ would be and it comes to 70$ per option contract. This makes AMD weekly options 94.4% more expensive than INTCs. To get 50 of these it would cost you 3500$ and to finalize the comparison an increase of 6.24% would bring AMD to 95$. Assuming you could get the hypothetical 92.25$ contracts you would have 13750$ and an ROI of 393%. **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSparing you from going through the same process with the other examples I will just summarize (feel free to check and correct my math). \n\nMicron: 3.08% upward move contracts &lt; 90$ (they would be more expensive I am using 95 strike but its actually lower 94.4 to be precise) with an ROI at a 6.24% upwards move of 244%.\n\nTSM: 3.08% upward move contracts last price would be at around 83$ (volume and open interest is lower so last price is more divergent than ask/bid and would likely be higher than 83$) with an ROI at a 6.24% move of 518%. Also looks attractive but the ask/bid gap is quite high and low volume/open interest.\n\nI wont even do the example for NVDA because implied volatility is so high for these ranges the ROI example would be really low. Other semiconductor companies have the problem of having low volume as well, but I am sure there are others out there and you may even finda better deal. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow before you call me stupid I understand the reason why the INTC contracts are much cheaper than these other. The IV (Implied volatility is lower).  The premiums are lower because the contract writers don't expect as big of swings in INTC as they do others. My thesis is though that the market makers for these contracts are incorrectly modeling the IV of INTC stock lower than it should be. Much the same way they were with Micron a couple weeks ago.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis week INTC closed up 1.6%, Micron was up 1.95%, AMD down 4.8%, and TSM down 3.6%. This week as we know most of the markets had a small correction. As I had expected INTC outperformed its competition as well as the broad markets. The week before this one  INTC closed up 4% and YTD INTC is up 26.2%. \n\nGiven the combination of factors surrounding the semiconductor scene and Intel specifically, I find that the implied upward volatility on INTC should be higher, and that in not too long it will increase as it has done the past few weeks (although still very low). The main reason why INTC contracts are so cheap relative to competitors in the industry is a simple question of supply and demand. These more memetic and loved stocks options are more sought after by retail and on top of the \"real\" volatility premium another demand heavy premium accrues. Intel being hated in this sub for example has kept option premiums much lower than they would be if it was a fan favorite. \n\nSimilar things happen in sports betting. A favorite with a lot of demand will often move the lines beyond the house spread and sometimes produce an edge for an underdog. Intel is the underdog of this story, and an underdog with very high expected value. You might hate Intel but this could still be the play for you (so long as you believe the semiconductor scene is bound to profit these weeks). \n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks are not favorites to win the championship this year (odds at +750). They probably wont win the championship and I don't see much value in that bet at the moment, but if someone was selling me Bucks futures at +5000 Id snag them up. This is the analogy I will use for the current Intel option market. \n\nI am a degenerate. There is no shame in coming out as one in this sub, a family of autistic degenerates from all over the world. I like to gamble and so do you, but more than gamble I like to make money. I like to win and I do win. \n\nI have 50, 65$ INTC contracts expiring the coming Friday, 500 contracts at 80$ strike for April 16 , as well as 1700 shares long. I believe in this play in the short term and long term. \n\nFor the short term, a long shot bet, but not nearly as much as the option writers have them. \n\nThis is deep fucking value.  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**  **\ud83d\ude80**"], "2021-02-21": [], "2021-02-22": [], "2021-02-23": [], "2021-02-24": [], "2021-02-25": [""], "2021-02-26": [], "2021-02-27": [], "2021-02-28": [], "2021-03-01": [], "2021-03-02": [], "2021-03-03": ["[deleted]"], "2021-03-04": [], "2021-03-05": [], "2021-03-06": [], "2021-03-07": [], "2021-03-08": [], "2021-03-09": ["In the past 6 hours on r/WallStreetBets...\n\n 1.

It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.

If you were following along with my [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/real_zlparker) you will have gotten periodic updates. It seems like every time that I have an important life event, whether it is a birthday or I go on vacation, the markets decide to sell off. Maybe I should stop going on vacations or buy hedges when I do? \n\nIt has been a rough start to the week, and not going into Thursday's session, futures are pointing up, but mostly flat. Yellen has indicated that we might need to raise interest rates sooner than later and it has started a profit taking frenzy, especially felt in tech and growth. Even thought Powell and the Federal Reserve has reiterated many times that rates wont increase until at least 2023, there has been some serious fear, uncertainty and doubt circulating in the markets. \n\nMy plan for times like these is always the same. I'll be going light on short term options plays, incase we are down or flat. If we keep seeing pullbacks, I'll be cutting all short term positions and dollar cost averaging into my long term positions. For my old LEAPS, I might start rolling them out. It is already May, the year is almost half over and some of my mid term positions are still flat. The decay will start kicking in at some point, and I want to be ready. \n\nIn summation: tread carefully in short term positions, sideways markets are painful for options, consider rolling out your mid term options, possibly cut short term and DCA into long term high conviction options, hold your high conviction commons even if it means not looking at them during down times. \n\n*\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_*\n\n**Trades From This Week So Far:**  \n\n*Swings*:  \n\n[$BTC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=cashtag_click) 14% \n\n[$GEVO](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GEVO&amp;src=cashtag_click) 2% \n\n$COIN 2%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Rolled:*\n\n$COIN 5/21 $315c at $4.40\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Open Options:*\n\n$F 6/4 $12c at $0.32: +9%\n\n*\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_*\n\n**Short Term Options to Consider: (remember follow on Twitter for actual trades I do)**\n\n*NKE 5/21 $135c at $1.25:*\n\n(changed this one a little) NIKE has gotten beat down so much, in fact all the way to the 180MA on the day chart, and it has bounced off that support.

Unless there is a very positive catalyst in the next day or two, I feel like we will continue selling off. It was a wild ride with good tech earnings, but we were already pricing it in. This is a key for many tech names. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cleykynh5gx61.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e21599b6bc54888fe3405b893c3de1b3fa0c98b"], "2021-05-07": [], "2021-05-08": [], "2021-05-09": [], "2021-05-10": [], "2021-05-11": [], "2021-05-12": [], "2021-05-13": ["NVidia just drooped, but we can see that its a temporary correction, in the long run the stock will go to 600-700$"], "2021-05-14": [], "2021-05-15": [], "2021-05-16": [], "2021-05-17": [], "2021-05-18": [], "2021-05-19": [], "2021-05-20": ["Hey guys,\nLooking to overhaul my portfolio \n\nHow does:\n55% VT\n10% QQQ\n10% QQQJ\n\nand remaining in stocks of: $MSFT, $V, $NVDA, $DIS, $AMZN, $BRKB and some crypto sound?\n\nShould I do 65% VT, 5% QQQ and 5% QQQJ?\n\nThanks!"], "2021-05-21": [], "2021-05-22": [], "2021-05-23": [], "2021-05-24": [], "2021-05-25": [], "2021-05-26": [""], "2021-05-27": [], "2021-05-28": [], "2021-05-29": [], "2021-05-30": ["This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find last weeks post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nj7tco/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!   \n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/ke62zgv6o9271.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67333daccbb4aefc351eff62aad5e9d8b0f1d40b)\n\nOverall, it was a good week for meme stocks in the market. It took a 176% rally in AMC stock price in one week to finally dethrone GME and become the most discussed stock of the week.  GME is a close second and had an exceptional week in the market. Virgin Galactic also made into the top 10 list due to them successfully completing their spaceflight. Another newcomer to the list is BlackBerry. If a stock could run for President, it should probably be BlackBerry as the percentage of people who have a bullish outlook on the stock far outweighs any other stock which is reflected in the sentiment. Electric car makers are still continuing to generate interest following the launch of Ford\u2019s F150 lightning. \n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**  \n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/kpnkug68o9271.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c88d4c286c7bf60e4e94cbf0ac3760cba0a90b35)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks in the list.\n\n**Virgin Galactic ($SPCE):** \n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/6b1p1y39o9271.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f64d87ae205fce62b2be427ecd81638af12b868)\n\nNo points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. Virgin Galactic exploded in mentions due to its SpaceShipTwo craft (pictured above) reaching space. This marked the company\u2019s first flight in more than two years and they expect to launch paying customers as soon as 2022. Wall Street analysts have flip-flopped on their rating first downgrading the stock price by 33% and then upgrading it back to their earlier recommendation (a 50% hike). Overall, the company has already reached the consensus 12-month price target of $31.20 and has risen a cool 25% in the last week.\n\n**Beyond Meat($BYND):** The stock has rallied 28% last week mainly following commentary from CNBC's Jim Cramer. On his Mad Money show, Cramer said the WallStreetBets crowd should make Beyond Meat the next meme stock to drive a short squeeze. He specifically noted that almost 25% of $BYND shares are held short, setting up a scenario for sharp gains. Since Wednesday, there has been a continuous stream of $BYND YOLO\u2019s and DDs across Reddit sparking the rise in the discussion.\n\n**BlackBerry($BB):** shares jumped as much as 12% Wednesday amid cheers from Redditors and a broader rally in meme stocks. One important thing to note here is BlackBerry's short interest still remains below 10% of shares outstanding, meaning any short squeeze wouldn't have too much room to run. [This](https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/) article has an interesting theory where they argue that BlackBerry by any other name would have a much higher valuation.\n\n**NVIDIA($NVDA):** announced a stellar quarter with revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier, and Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. They are projecting a record $6.3B revenue next quarter. The stock experienced a delayed earnings reaction and has gained 8.4% this week. Considering how hard it was to buy the new NVIDIA product, I don\u2019t expect their revenue growth to plateau anytime soon.\n\n**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** was trending as the stock passed the $1-mark last Friday. For those who are not familiar with the company, it was ridden up from 60 cents to almost $3 within one month last February. With the current rally in stock price and with the price getting over the psychological barrier of $1, interest seems to be picking up.\n\nSOME FAQ\u2019s:\n\n**How does the program work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).\n\n**What is sentiment:** It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also (eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*"], "2021-05-31": []}
