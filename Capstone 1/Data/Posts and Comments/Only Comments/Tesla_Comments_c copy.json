Otherwise, we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road. So, while we do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the batteries to make cars that that we've already got already on our plate.\n\nThis is why the Semi is maybe coming in 2021 instead of 2019 like it was supposed to. \n\nIt should be pretty obvious that making big batteries is limited by number of batteries but from this article,\n\n[https://electrek.co/2020/08/14/tesla-increasing-powerwall-production-elon-musk-delivery-delays-2021/](https://electrek.co/2020/08/14/tesla-increasing-powerwall-production-elon-musk-delivery-delays-2021/)\n\nLong delays, prices just got increased, production is trying to ramp. I'm going to say they're supply constrained. For what is just a big battery in a shell, it's probably batteries being the limiting factor.\n\nSo every kWh Tesla deploys in storage is one kWh in cars on the road and losing them automotive revenue; every kWh in car is one less kWh deployed in storage and losing them energy revenue. It's zero-sum and direct competition in terms of battery supply. From the earlier calculation energy storage is taking around 7% of Tesla's total batteries. \n\nThe point was that Tesla energy is still growing, only the increased production is mostly going into cars. At $520/kWh for a Powerwall with cells costing $100/kWh it's kinda ridiculous. You can buy an entire Model 3 LR for $46.5k, that has 75 kWh for $620/kWh. Once battery is no longer a bottleneck and isn't competing with their automotive segment their energy segment revenue will explode.\n\nSay their car production rate stays fixed and battery production doubles. Tesla puts all spare battery capacity going into storage, then we would see 2 \\* 11,635 MWh total battery production with 10,875 MWh going into cars, and 12,395 MWh going into storage (+1,600% from current)."], "2021-01-13": ["Yes this is correct: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest)", "Sorry, your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kwdsup/tsla/) in /r/stocks has been automatically removed due to Rule 3:  Low effort.\n\nIf you just want to post 1 liners or just want to know everyone's thoughts, then post a comment to our daily discsusion thread which are generally stickied or [click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+daily+discussion&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/), and **especially** [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) **which aggregates the most news for almost every stock**.\n\nIf instead you're wondering what a term means, go to Investopedia.com and search for said term there.\n\nEither way come back here to repost with your findings, thanks!\n\nA list of the [rules can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/rules/), and if you're new to r/stocks please see the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and/or [read this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4x1419/if_youre_new_here_read_this_post_first/)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It seems coordinated but .. why? Some theories (pure speculation on my part):\n\n* keep a lid on TSLA in case they issue new shares. Our new best bear said it and i didn't think of anything at the time.. but TSLA issues new shares right after 10Q of 10K releases. So to limit the upside for Tesla by institutions that want to slow tesla down, keeping a lid on the share price makes sense. If right, this goes away next week.\n\n* Reduce options volatility. Imagine some big players wants to get a large amount of long dated calls. It makes sense to suppress the share price temporarily to reduce options premium. I would keep an eye on long dated calls today and next week. Don't know how to do this though.\n\n* a paper hand shakedown. Imagine a bunch of managed index funds want to buy tsla to keep their books clean. Hedge funds want to supply these shares a nice premium just like the for the index funds at S&amp;P inclusion. But the share price is not cooperating due to low supply. Shorting is a bad idea with the current prospect of Bidens green energy focus and teslas undeniable expansion. So to get more shared, create a bear sentiment to loosen some shares. If right, look for large closing cross transactions in the coming weeks.\n\nI realize these are all bullish scenarios.
