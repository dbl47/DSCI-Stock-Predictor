Crashes will usually result in the screen freezing, becoming unresponsive, and then a black screen for a moment, followed by the PC searching for my monitor as if it is looking for hardware, and when found, I return to desktop. Sometimes, the crash is severe enough that it does not find the monitor and a reboot is initiated after about 30 seconds (my guess is that the GPU fails, but then fails to restart).\n\nIt only seems to occur with certain games that are \"newer\" (Rust, Star Wars Battlefront II) but spares some games that are older (Company of Heroes). \n\nCiv VI was also a crash causer, but after lowering settings to minimum I haven't experienced any crashes (even though on max settings I run said game comfortably FPS, just unpredictable crashes). I can't seem to determine which individual setting could be the culprit.\n\nI adjusted the settings for other games with no luck.\n\nI have tried the following:\n\n\\-Ensuring the GPU drivers are the most up to date\n\n\\-Downloading and using nVidia GE Force Experience\n\n\\-Changing PCI Express -&gt; Link State Power Management to \"Off\"\n\n\\-Switching off Vsync\n\n\\-Switching to DX12 in supported games (and then back to DX11 after this didn't seem to resolve anything)\n\n\\-Virus scans\n\n\\-\"Rolling back\" drivers in the device manager, and then reinstalling drivers\n\n\\-Using DDU to remove all drivers in safe mode, and then reinstalling drivers directly from nVIDIA and not Windows update\n\nStill no luck. I do not see large fluctuations in power use or temperature when I am playing. Games that  I used to run for hours 60+ FPS now crash frequently. I built this PC in August and this only became an issue \\~November, with no major software/hardware changes.\n\nI posted this in BuildaPC reddit, and was advised to just completely reinstall windows - I'd prefer not to do this but I will if I have to.\n\nI have crash logs for Civ VI and SW Battlefront II, and can probably get them for Rust, but I have no idea how to open them. I can also post my DxDiag if that is of any use. Any advice?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n [PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Dw7Fcq)\n\n|Type|Item|\n|:-|:-|\n|**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.4 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/jLF48d/amd-ryzen-5-2600-34ghz-6-core-processor-yd2600bbafbox)|\n|**Motherboard**|[Gigabyte B450M DS3H WIFI Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/HQVG3C/gigabyte-b450m-ds3h-wifi-micro-atx-am4-motherboard-b450m-ds3h-wifi)|\n|**Memory**|[Team T-FORCE VULCAN Z 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JmyV3C/team-t-force-vulcan-z-16-gb-2-x-8-gb-ddr4-3200-memory-tlzrd416g3200hc16cdc01)|\n|**Storage**|[Western Digital Blue SN550 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/BhmFf7/western-digital-blue-sn550-1-tb-m2-2280-nvme-solid-state-drive-wds100t2b0c)|\n|**Video Card**|[Asus GeForce GTX 1650 SUPER 4 GB TUF GAMING OC Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/DNyqqs/asus-geforce-gtx-1650-super-4-gb-tuf-gaming-oc-video-card-tuf-gtx1650s-o4g-gaming)|\n|**Case**|[MUSETEX Phantom ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/RYmFf7/musetex-phantom-atx-mid-tower-case-903-s6)|\n|**Power Supply**|[EVGA 600 W 80+ Certified ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4FH48d/evga-600w-80-certified-atx-power-supply-100-w1-0600-k1)|\n|Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2021-01-02 23:54 EST-0500||", "Its never worth it to use GE for crp.

You may want to talk to an advisor about what you should do, course repeat or course forgiveness, because if you only have 16 units for course forgiveness, you may not want to use it all for GE classes since you still have many other semesters ahead of you and you may want that course forgiveness for major prep or major specific classes.

That comment is just ignorant. It is very clear to most players that Mod Ash goes above and beyond for his love of the game and puts more time/work into the game than he is likely paid for or expected to work.

He was even lucky to get ang chance of involvement after what he put me through for the last year of dating him. I am currently not dating him as he has a new gf now. I am unsure on how to deal with him since I am scared of him, I currently have him blocked after being a prick to me and my family and HIS family as well. But I am just unsure on what to do \ud83d\ude30\n\nSo I (17F) am currently pregnant, I am 22 weeks into it atm and the dad (21M) only recently found out about the baby. \nSo little backstory, I'm pretty sure some people might say that cause of our age I would be able to get him arrested but I cant do that where I'm from since 16 is legally the age of consent. \nBut when I was 16 and he was 20 we started dating just before the covid pandemic started and things were fine then, we were happy, playful, you know, all those things that happen at the start of a relationship, before the arguments. When the lockdown started to kick in we decided for me to live with him instead of with my mum so we would be together during lockdown. It was fine until problems started to rise, like, we would have to go shopping (usually really early in the morning) and there would usually be a very long line outside the shop, usually of old people. He would comment on how people were being \"selfish\" and not \"sticking to covid rules\" there was a time he said that he hoped all the elderly people just died so he would get what he wanted. But he would comment on how selfish people were being even tho we were doing the exact same thing they were doing. \nThere was also the time we had to take my cat from my mums because my mum had just gotten a new puppy and they weren't getting along very well. So we took on the cat and he would do nothing but complain and complain about how the cat was annoying because she mowed too loud or even purred too loud! Also the cat wouldnt use the litter tray and instead used his sink most the time to do her business.. whenever she did that I would clean it up but it still bothered him so since she was a outdoor cat he decided that when she had adjusted to the house he would kick her out the house to go outside and spend most the day outside. I had to start bringing her food outside to the door so she could eat because he refused to let her back in for more than 10 minutes. There was one night she was able to squeeze into the house through the living room window then I woke up to her right at my face purring and rubbing her head on me. I got up and decided to feed her then but then my bf(at the time) woke up and accused me of sneaking her in the house and waking him up. At one point she didnt come back for almost 2 weeks then when she did it looked like she was limping. I phoned my mum and told her and we were able to get her in to see the vet but my mum ended up going into the vet and me and my bf had to stay in her car and wait. He didnt like that, he didnt like having to wait 10 minutes for the cat to be checked by the vet so he basically threw a tantrum in the back of my mums car while she was in the vets, keep in mind hes 20 years old at this time. My mum came back with the cat and told us the vet said it had looked like the cat had been hit by a car and hurt her leg. Hopefully it wasnt too serious though, she got some medication and was told she had to stay indoors for at least 2 or 3 weeks. When we got back to my bfs home we started arguing about how he wanted to kick her out the house again but I woudlnt let him because her leg was injured! But he didnt understand that and just said \"shes a animal, they're suppose to be outside, they dont need to be indoors at all\" we argued for a while until I phoned my mum in tears telling her that we couldnt keep the cat anymore, she was able to take her back. The cat and the dog actually started getting along when she got back to my mums house and her leg fully recovered by the way. \nAnyway me and my bf would have sex, usually daily or whenever he wanted to. After a while it just kinda felt like I was doing a chore tbh.. but I was suppose to be on the pill during this time but I wasnt because my bf said it should be all natural and if I got pregnant then that would just be destiny.. (i know now how stupid i was to believe him and do what he said) after being with him for about 6 months I started to have break downs, I would randomly start crying about anything and I just felt anxious all the time, so I decided to get help. I phoned my doctor and asked if I could speak to a mental health nurse. I got this lovely woman I would speak to her on the phone about things then when I told her there was somethings I felt that I wasnt safe saying over the phone while at my bfs house she was able to get me a face fo face appointment to talk to me about things af my bfs. I told her about what it was like, how I felt, and she did a kinda test with me, just like asking questions and at the end she ended up telling me I wasnt in a very healthy situation. As I had told her that he had threatened to slit my throat before if I decided to leave him and that he had said that if i ever got pregnant then I would be stuck with him(again, I know how stupid I was for ignoring the obvious warning signs) but she told me that I was In a toxic relationship and that I needed to leave. I was thinking about it, but was too scared to do it at the time.\nRound about this time my mum messaged me saying she wanted me round at hers cause she wanted to tell me something important face to face... I was able to get permission to go to my mums alone(yes I needed permission to go places alone). I got to my mums and she broke the news to me that my gran was found with cancer and that it was terminal so there was nothing they could do to help her.. my gran had been getting painful headaches for months by this time and we didnt know what it was. She was getting tested loads. And a lot of her appointments had to be delayed due to covid. They didnt find the cancer until her last scan, a fully body scan were they found it all over her body.. it had spread so much that it was everywhere.. it was heartbreaking for me since I had never lost a family member before so it would be the first death of the family for some of my family members.. \nSo I got back to my bfs and told him the news, he did comfort me for a bit and i layed in bed all day the next day but then the day after he just accused me of being lazy and was using my grans illness as a excuse to not go outside and exercise (we usually went out for daily walks..) when in reality I was just really upset about my gran.. \nabout a month passes and my gran only gets worse.. we get told she has months, then we would get told she had weeks then to be told she had days until eventually being told.. she only had hours left.. \nI was at my mums house that day with my bf, there was a few family members there(and yes I know we shouldnt have been around eachother but this was about the time my family partly didn't believe in covid) \nAnyway, I was sitting on the floor, my bf was next to me and my other family members were on the couch. All of us were drinking. Then my mum got a call.. was a nurse that told my mum that my gran had sadly passed away... I lost her on August 14th 2020.. the last time I ever saw her she broke down crying because she didnt feel comfortable being around my bf..\nWe all drank for most the night until 1am.. me and my bf started walking home and of course he decided to have a go at me about how bad my family was and that he didnt like my older brother because he looked at him weird.. we got to his and I snapped. After him yelling at me, I just got up and walked out his house. I wondered my town for a while, alone(I was drunk as well) my mum messaged me, my bf messaged me, he wanted me to \"come home\" so eventually I went \"home\", I walked to my mums house and stayed there, (everyone else was asleep by this time) my bf was messaging me still telling me to \"come home\" to which I replied \"I am home. I'm at my mums house\" he blew up about how I lived with him and not my mum anymore we argued, he phoned me and we basically just yelled at eachother for ages. At some point, idk why but I decided to let him come to mine and I decided to stay with him again.. after a bit we were told about my grans upcoming funeral, that my bf was not invited to. He was NOT happy. And u guessed it, moore arguing \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 the day before the funeral I broke up with him (I think it was just before the funeral that I actually got pregnant as well) \nA few days after the funeral I did end up going back to him because I was in a vulnerable place..\nWas with him for about a month, pubs had just opened back up at this time and ge would take me to the pub, even though I was underage. I never had a drink there, I would just sit in the pub and be quiet while he got drunk and had a laugh with the people there. There was a employee at the pub that knew me and my age but she never kicked me out, they just let me stay because I was so quiet. \nThen came the day of the last break up. He went to the pub and I went home because I felt tired. I was just about to go to sleep when he starts asking if I want to go out with him and his friend in the car (his friend was gonna be driving but he also didnt have a license so it was a horrible idea) I said no at first but then he just kept begging.. I gave in.. after about a hour of driving around town, police started to catch on that we were going around town. I started getting scared and i was having very bad cramps at the time(I now know that that was a sign of me being pregnant since I was also late at this time) I wanted to go home but we couldnt stop the car because the police were chasing us. I started crying.. and that escalated into my bf calling me a piece of shit and a pussy and that I was scared of pigs.. I was scared of police, I didnt want to get charged or anything.. we ended up in another town, once losing the police we ditched the car. I had never been in this town before so I didnt know where I was and I didnt have my phone with me as well. At one point my bfs friend ran away from us and we lost him. We were wondering the street then the police spotted us and my bf was pretty well known by the police so they knew he was involved. Asked us questions, he stupidly said he recorded the police chase on his phone so the police took his phone off him for evidence. The police left us after he told them where the car was hidden and we were stranded. No phones, no way of getting home. We argued and once again I snapped and decided to walk away from him and leave him. Police later found me and kindly gave me a lift home. \nThe police asked me questions and asked for a statement, which I gave then they dropped me off at my mums house. They then advised me to stay away from my bf because he was nothing but bad news. I later broke up with him and blocked him on everything cause I knew that if I didnt block him then he would either harass me or try to get back with me again. I was proud of myself. \nBut then..\n10 days later I was speaking to the mental health nurse again and I told her that I was worried I was pregnant because I was about 2 weeks late. So she bought me a pregnancy test and I took 2 of the tests. Both came back positive.. I was scared, I felt alone, i didn't know what to do.. i did later figure it all out and for about a month or 2 i was deeply in the mindset of abortion but then i told my mum that i was pregnant and she was fully supportive about it.. I was so happy.. I decided to keep it because I was was gonna get help and support through it all. If I never told my mum then I probably would have aborted the baby. Round about December time I got my first scan and I think I was 17 weeks by that time? We then decided to post on Facebook about my baby and people were happy and excited for me \ud83d\ude0a\nI also decided to tell my ex's mum because she wouldve been the \"other gran\" so I decided to let her get involvement to be part of her grandchild life. Her and my ex dont really get on that well as well. But I felt her know and she was grateful that I decided to tell her rather than not let her be involved at all. She is a sweet woman. At 20 weeks I got to find out my babies gender and was told it was a girl! I had names in store for her by this time anyway. I decided on alexis for her name and I wanted Elizabeth for her middle name because it was my grans name and since she never got the chance to know about a future great grandchild it meant a lot to me. But at 21 weeks I decided to put my scan pictures at my cover photo on Facebook and my ex's friend saw it and asked who the dad was. I told them who it was and they told my ex. By this time I expected him to already know about the baby by this time and thought he just didnt care since by this time he had a new gf and was getting involved with police and other stuff. But he was able to get in contact with me and asked if it was true. I said I was and explained the situation and how I had dealt with everything and how I had put in for my own place and how I had put in applications for money so it would help me. He said he wanted involvement so I decided to give him 1 chance to change his ways and prove he could be a good dad. He was doing good at first, he poured his last drinks down the drain and started looking for a job. Me and him started talking again and he was being nice at first and just asking questions about the baby. He then asked if he could get stuff for the baby and I told him to \"hold off\" from getting baby stuff since I was getting stuff given to me from people for free and I would let him know when I have everything, if I needed anything else cause I didnt want too much stuff. He said \"yea that's fine\" he then asked about names. I told him that I had already chose a name for the baby and he was fine with alexis. What really got to him was the fact that HIS name wasnt gonna be part of their name. I told him I would \"think about it\". I then notice his gf posting about wanting to take selfies with babies and how she couldn't wait for it. Which pissed me off cause I saw it as if she thought she was gonna get to take a selfie with MY baby as if it was hers! My ex was the same. He was posting about how he couldnt wait to meet her and how he was gonna spoil her and his friend made a joke about how police would be at his door from her crying during the night. I then told him that he wouldnt get to see her everyday, just some days. I said I would be busy somedays anyway, his response to that was \"well then when ur busy, I'll just take her\" I ignored him after that. Next day we were talking and at one point I didnt reply to his message. So he got mad and decided to post on Facebook about how much of a selfish person I was and how he wasnt allowed to get his \"little princess\" clothes that said \"daddies little princess\" even tho I never said that because i said that he just had to \"hold off\" from getting stuff and i would let him know if i needed more. I decided to comment on his post because of the comments he was getting from people supporting HIM(someone even told him to get legal help) I commented saying what really happened and how he did all this because I didnt reply to his message! He then told me that he should've been the first person told about the baby. I blocked him again after that. He then had a go at my mum and said \"how dare you post on ur Facebook about MY BABY\" she ended up blocking him as well. \nI later found out he had been drinking as well. \n\nSo now I'm here, in my bed contemplating what I should do about the situation cause I know hes not gonna stop there and he will try to do something else. I'm not sure what but itll be something. Is there any advice anyone has? Cause I'm just stumped on what I could do about him.. \n (btw IF r/slash reads this out I just wanna say i love ur videos and u really helped me get by some days during these hard times)", "If i only took what i wanted to see or only read what i wanted, instead of an actual understanding of the \"essay\"(please tell me you don't have a diploma if that's considered a full correct essay.)

Only one of us can apply through this quota. Now the department has different jobs according to your level of education. I have a high school degree while my sister has a college degree. She'd get a higher post and a higher pay. While I'll be at the bottom of the system and I'll also have to drop out of college. The thing is, i don't want to. My dad had wanted us to get quality education and not settle for anything. I don't want to compromise on my education for a job that has basically no growth and one promotion in 10-12 years. Meanwhile I believe my sister will excel in her career as she would be going for a higher level post. Even though she had other dreams and was working towards them. \n\nMy extended family has been pestering me to get the job because:\n1) My sister is a graduate and is capable of getting a good paying job because of her degree. \n\n2) My mom wouldn't have to pay the rest of my \"enormous tuition fee\" and I would get my own job. \n\nThey have been passing backhanded and passive aggressive comments these past few weeks and keep justifying it by saying they just want me to secure my future because according to them I am not that bright of a student and we are wasting this golden opportunity as my sister can easily get a job.\n\nMy sister told me that I don't have to sacrifice on my dreams and my life to do this and that she'll do it. This is where I feel like an asshole. I wanted her to take it so that I didn't have to. And if I'm not willing to sacrifice my future life and dreams, why should she have to? Just because she's older? This is so fucked up and I feel so bad. \n\nPlease don't tell suggest finding other options. Its her or me. And I don't want it to be me.

He never did until one day I was on the bus from school and he calls me to come meet him at his friends house and i did not want to go because i didn\u2019t want to sit around while his friends did drugs. this made him very angry. so my dumb ass goes anyway. By the way i lost a friend over this.. I see him he grabs me by the arm and continues to yell at me in public telling me what a c***t i am for not meeting up with him sooner. Threatening to fight anyone who looked at us.\nIt was bad.\n\nAfter that day our relationship went down hill. we fought every day because he would just get so angry at me for no reason.\n\none time we ordered food from this place.

Also threw that out, meanwhile i\u2019m paying for all this crap.. also he was very dirty and lived in dirty.. \n\nMany occasions he would show up at my job screaming and embarrassing me. i had to tell them to tell him i was not there...  idk why i dealt with it. i wanted to leave but i was so scared. i actually thought he was gonna kill me if did. \nhe ended up getting bed bugs and i bought him all new sheets and blankets  and didn\u2019t even get a thank you. \n\nthen one day a miracle happens and he breaks up with me... HE BROKE UP WITH ME. and i just thought to myself. i\u2019m finally free... even though he didn\u2019t not \nnecessarily physically abuse me. what he put me through i do not wish on anyone.. \n\nhe did try to ge back with me and even texted me once asking me if i was gonna tell everyone we ate back together .like huh? \n\nnow he has a kid and all i can say is wow i dodged a bullet..", "Deal link: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/GE-Polarized-Grounding-Adapter-14404/dp/B00B7PK1TC/ref=asc_df_B00B7PK1TC/?tag=reddnapp-20)\n\n--- \n**Category-wise subreddits for Amazon Deals:**\n\nIs your reddit feed getting flooded with deals for products you are not interested in?

Your sneaky ploy with Settled has worked and youve added another 10 swords to your backpack.", "Yeah, very low level armour is generally a bit hard to come by on the GE, apart from folks who overcharge massively. \n\nThing is that the way the xp curve is, being a \"low level\" is very short lived. Most people will skip entire categories of armors just cause of how easily you level up at the very lower end. \n\nAs far as armour goes, I'd say you will only dependably start finding them on the GE at around lv50 or so, starting with the Dagannoth Kings power armour (skeletal, rockshell and spines for mage melee and range respectively) . Price gouging is still very common at times, but leaving your offers overnight usually works out.\n\nEdit:\n\nIf you need me to craft you anything, shoot me a PM here on Reddit and we'll swap RSN's", "Perhaps, but Zezima is no fool.

Imagine if there was a clan that determined profit sharing from raids by how many rune swords you had in the bank, *even if you don't participate in the raids*. The leader of the clan is the only person in the game that can smith rune swords (not even jmods) and any money he makes from smithing rune swords and selling them on the GE has to be used to help the clan do more raids. \n\nHe can smith a bunch of rune swords to bail out the short seller, but he'd only do that if needed to raise a ton of money and quickly for his clan.", "Sure, I'll write something out for you quick..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nZezima has 1 rune long sword. You borrow it off Zezima and agree to pay him 1gp/day interest, and sell it on to Lynx for 20k. You owe Zezima 1 rune long and 1gp/day, and you now have 20k cash.\n\nYou did this because you heard that in 7 days Jagex will change the alch value of a rune long from 20k to 10k. When this happens you'll be able to buy it back for 10k, return it to Zezima, pay Zezima 7gp loan value and keep the difference of 9,993gp for yourself. Stonks.\n\nIf, in the between the time you sold and rebuy that sword, Jagex buff the rune long to f2p BiS and everyone wants one, the price may rise to 40k. You still must return the loan to Zezima and pay the interest. You still have 20k from the initial sale, but must pay another 20k to buy it back, meaning that you are now down 20,007gp including interest. Not stonks. This is the natural risk associated with this strategy.\n\nNow imagine that you borrow 100 swords from Zezima and sell them on for 20k ea, expecting the alch value nerf. Of those 100, Lynx buys 40 of them and the rest sell on the GE at rate. You then approach Lynx and ask to borrow his swords, he accepts at the same interest rate as Zezima, and you then sell them on the GE. Despite there only being 100 swords in existence you now owe a total loan of 140 swords, 100 to Zezima and 40 to Lynx.\n\nIf the nerf happens youre fine. Remember, you sold them for 20k. If you rebuy at 10k per sword you're looking at 140 swords at 10k profit, minus (100x7gp)+(40x7gp) in interest, for a cool 1,399,020 gp.\n\nWhat happens if Alkan and A Friend realise you owe 140 swords but there are only 100 swords on the market? They decide they will buy some rune longs because when the time comes for you to return your loans they plan on being able to dictate how much they cost. Alkan has some big balls and buys 75 longswords, while A Friend has flashbacks to his gambling website history and only grabs 5. There are now only 20 swords available for all f2p, and for you to reclaim, because Alkan and A Friend are holding theirs. The prices rise to 30k, then 40k, then 50k.\n\nYou're shitting buckets of ultracompost because not only are you paying 980gp of interest a day, you must now pay an extra 30k on top of your original 20k sell price to reclaim your swords to return them to Zezima and Lynx. This is massively big not stonks.\n\nYou call your boys at the Varrock Herald and the Al Kharid flier press to say that keeping hold of Rune Longs are bad. And scary. You hope that the f2p noobs will panic and sell their swords, making the price reduce and reduce so your losses aren't so bad.\n\nWhen this doesnt happen you tell the G.E. clerks that no one is allowed to buy any more rune swords. Additionally, if any f2p noobs, Alkan or A Friend get nervous they are allowed to sell their swords, but only to you. This goes against long-standing GE market principles and is pretty much illegal. The f2p noobs hold strong but Dovy folds and sells 5 swords. \n\nSo far you've only recuperated (at a maximum) 25 swords, youre still paying interest on the loaned swords every day, and because Alkan and the f2p noobs are holding their swords youre getting more and more desperate to buy them. \n\nThey don't want to sell because they love to see you bleed gps. For years you've been holding all the party hats on RS3 and the Druidic on OSRS, only eating anglers during slayer, making dragon darts for fetching and you've got like 8 POH's stacked with demonic thrones. You're now in a stalemate position where you don't want to pay exorbitant prices for the swords (think 40m per sword (irl 0.40c&gt;$400.00), but the current holders of the swords know that you'll have no option but to buy them back, because Zezima and Lynx aren't going to let you skip out on the gp their loaned shares are worth.\n\n:D", "Hi, yes that sounds like exactly what I want to do. Can I do that without setting up anything? (By just importing GE?)", "It's not about making money my guy.  It's about sending a message.

Would I get the best RP by spending few GE for Iacobi's J8A? \n\nYes. Vehicles are generally only effective for grinding vehicles at their tier and 1 tier above and below. The J8A for is thus only good for grinding tier 1 and 2, but grinding vehicles at these tiers doesn't cost a lot of time, so it is generally not worth it. You'd be better off with buying a tier 3, 4 or 5 premium.\n\nP.S. I suggest you do also try to enjoy your time playing a tree and not just rush to the end as fast as possible. In my oppinion you can have fun in this game, which a lot of players sadly have yet to figure out.", "For your first question: As someone who\u2019s got Sweden done, no, don\u2019t do it as your first tree. It\u2019s the smallest tree, but if you\u2019re new, it\u2019s the most painful. Repair costs are sky high for most of Sweden\u2019s planes, they are mostly average to below average overall with the exception of the early fighters having spectacular gun armament and until you reach the top, literally the J35D, you do not have a supersonic jet. Add to that there\u2019s some (Mostly unneeded, imo) BR changes coming to that tree.\n\nThere are certainly standouts in the tree, don\u2019t get me wrong but overall, it is a very long, difficult grind.\n\nAs for your second question, premium vehicles usually give you the best RP conversion one tier above where they sit and then all tiers below, so generally the higher you go, the easier it is. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t spend GE or money on a premium vehicle unless you are absolutely sure about it.", "Thanks! That's interesting. I came across this awhile back.

Golfers Elbow is the aggravation of the common flexor tendon.\n\nWhy is it called the common flexor tendon? Because it is a common attachment point for 5 muscles!\n\nWhat do those five muscles do? Pretty much most of the flexion motions below the elbow from rotating the wrist (pronation), to flexing the fingers, flexing the wrist, abducting the hand, etc.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_flexor_tendon\n\nSo what does that mean if you have Golfer's Elbow? It means any of five motions is aggravating a single tendon.\n\nAnd, as the the top comment and AthleanX say, there's an illogical 5th motion (horizontal pulling) that also may aggravate that tendon.\n\nYou have to isolate all the motions and figure out which motion(s) are aggravating the common flexor tendon and rehab those.\n\nI think this is why Rippletoe GE sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Rippletoe attempts to use a compound move to cure 4 (possibly 5) motions that cause GE tendonitis. However, the common advice to cure tendonitis is to isolate specific motions. I think then Rippletoe works, it is similar enough to isolation motion to the particular motion causing GE in that specific case.\n\nHere's a post I wrote about how to test which motions are causing your GE. Do heavier weight with each motion to intentionally aggravate. Write down which motions aggravate and rehab those motions specifically:\n\nhttps://amp.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cv57v0/theres_a_fourth_possible_cause_of_golfers_elbow/\n\nNotice I don't include hand abduction because I didn't know as much about anatomy back then. But hand abduction is rare amongst resistance sports athletes, but it's basically swinging a hammer from the wrist.\n\nGolfers Elbow is the worst symptom ever because the triggering motions are so diverse. The joke I like to say is, \"a man goes to the doctor and says, 'my toe has been bothering me for a year. It really hurts when I walk.' The doctor says, 'ah it may be broken, let's take a look.' the patient takes off his shoe and his toe has a giant shard of glass embedded in it.\"\n\nGolfer's Elbow pain is the \"my toe hurts\" of tendonitis.\n\nEdit: You also have to stop aggravating the tendon. That means you may have to go rehab only for upper body (get strong legs in the meantime!) It's hard to hear, but a the rehab in the world ain't going to help if you keep re-aggravating through normal exercise.\n\nEdit2: I said there are 5 common flexor muscles, but if you are counting, I only list 4 motions (plus horizontal pulling.) The fifth muscle is an evolutionary vestige and it's unclear what motion it contributes to.", "I have the GE zwave switches and dimmers and they have worked great.

First, buy a couple of the $11 plugs from Amazon that are the C by GE smart plugs. These will act as a Bluetooth bridge over Wi-Fi. Secondly, delete all of the bulbs out of Google home and then go to manage Account on all attached Google accounts to the home and go to manage third-party access and see if there is a ghost C by GE seamless account hanging out and disconnect it and other C by GE accounts (I\u2019m not only talking about the \u201cManage linked accounts\u201d in the home app, but also managing third-party access inside of the Google account portal itself on their site. This is where I had a ghost C by GE Seamless account showing but not in the Home app linked accounts). Next, go to the C by GE app itself and add the plugs first and make sure they are on your network. Now add all the bulbs into the C by GE app. After you are finished, now link your account to google home and you should have all of your bulbs come in and should be able to control them thanks to the bridges (plugs). Without the plugs, the bulbs appeared but I was unable to control them with either Alexa or Google. When following this procedure, I am now able to control the bulbs from the C by GE app, Alexa, and Google home mini\u2018s without any issues or lag for the first time ever ever. You MUST use the bridge or plugs by GE for this to work and they must be added in the C by GE app (EVERYTHING). Now that the bridges are talking to the bulbs vs the Minis, I never have issues with bulbs not responding or errors about not being able to reach the C by GE service.

A potential solution I thought of was to bring back item lending services originally released not too long after the backup which 2007scape is built on (the service itself was even announced in 2007, albeit in December).\n\nAs a mid-level player myself, and one who is TERRIBLE at pvm, I had a hell of a time going for my fire cape even with the pre-nerf blowpipe. If mid-level players had the option to, say, rent a twisted bow for 24 hours to do fire cape attempts if they have the coin to finance the rental, then the pushback on nerfing the viable mid-level items may not be as big. It would also provide higher level players the opportunity to make passive income off of gear they aren\u2019t currently using. \n\nMy idea is to bring back the trading posts which were placed in every bank near the start of OSRS as lending posts instead, allowing players to search for items in an interface similar to the GE, and then seeing a list of players currently lending the item, the price they are charging, and for how long they are lending the item in an interface similar to the house advertisement board.

The issue you\u2019re describing can be fixed by simply forcing the rental fee to be a percentage of the item\u2019s GE value. For instance, if something costs 1m in the GE, it could cost 10% of the GE value per hour, or 100k per hour. Making rental fees reliant on GE prices would ensure that people can\u2019t just use incredibly ridiculous items for basically free. If prices drop too much, everyone will rent them, causing the GE price to rise because no one is buying them, making the rental fee rise as well. Eventually it becomes too expensive to keep renting, and the player will want to just buy one for themselves. Alternately, if prices rise too high, people will stop renting them, pushing players to sell off their extras rather than renting them out, and that extra supply on the market would lower the prices and thus the rental price as well. While the economy would be fairly volatile for awhile, I think most items would eventually find a settling point where people are comfortable with both the GE price and the rental price.", "They got rid of this on purpose with the Ninja GE strike.", "Hi!

On other games like Anno 1800, CPU temps were staying at 75C.  GPU on the other hand is very cool, ive not seen it higher than 68C in any game.

If I had to live with it myself, I would not, I\u2019d get a Bosch or Miele instead. The issues you have with your Whirlpool range I think stem mostly from it being a lower end product within their lineup and possibly because of its age. That said, coil electric and radiant electric stoves are the least responsive types of stoves, they take longer to heat up and to change temperatures, and they\u2019re not great at holding a constant temperature because the heating element is basically switching from being 100% on to totally off at a high frequency to maintain a lower than maximum temperature. I prefer a gas stove, but that\u2019s not an option for you. Some argue that electric induction stoves are even better than gas, it basically uses an electromagnetic field to turn the pot itself into a heating element. One of its drawbacks is that it won\u2019t work with non magnetic cookware such as copper, aluminum, or ceramic/glass, at least not without using an adapter plate (but when you use the adapter plate, you\u2019re losing most of the benefits that induction provides).\n\nI\u2019m not sure how terrible your cooking experience is with your current range, but I think the stove on the range I suggested will be *at least* moderately better and the oven will be significantly better. The oven has an additional heating element behind the convection fan and uses a digital temperature sensor to individually adjust the heating elements for more precise and even temperatures. \n\nFYI, Whirlpool also owns Amana, Maytag, and Kitchenaid. Some of the competing big appliance brands are GE Appliances which was acquired by a Chinese conglomerate a few years ago, Electrolux/Frigidaire, Bosch (they make great stuff but it\u2019s more of a premium tier product) then there are a bunch of luxury tier appliance brands, and plenty of brands to definitely avoid, such as Samsung (they\u2019re fine if your buying a TV or a phone, just don\u2019t buy an appliance from them).\n\nIf your budget was in the $9k range, I\u2019d probably recommend going all Bosch (Bosch also makes Thermador and Gaggenau, by the way).

Nice."], "2021-02-18": [" Heretics of Necromunda part 1.01:\n\nIn the grim dark future of mankind there is only war and a shit ton of role-playing potential. So, when offered a chance to enjoy a good old homebrew of dark heresy mixed in with Wrath and Glory, our RP group was quickly formed and jumped at the chance of starting what our anonymous dm promised to be an all guardsman party experience, but so much more epic. We spent the day rolling up our characters, building up our backstories, and at the end learned that we would all have our personality and lore knowledge \u201ctransported\u201d into the 41st millennia to play as our newly made characters. With that the whole entire group were made into Isekaied protagonists of the most infamous, murder your main character like series, that would make even Game of Thrones blush in envy. We were all allowed to take a couple of items or special abilities with us that our main characters would have on their person, a so-called blank check that the God like being responsible for our transportation, was graceful enough to give us before having us murdered brutally in the meat grinder. This could have been anything from a lightsaber, a demon blade from Devil may cry series, superpowers, to a heretical Eldar waifu pillow. The potential was as endless as the horrible deaths that awaited all of us in this nightmarishly dystopian future.\n\nSo that is how we started, as a recently established team of inquisitorial acolytes with meta knowledge of the setting aboard the Divine Devotion, a pristine Sword class inquisitorial vessel heading straight to the lovely hive world of Necromunda. There was Lord Daimen Everbright a noble psyker straight out from Holy Terra, Mok Glok a Viking looking feral worlder with a lawgiver gun acquired from the judge dread universe, Rajah Mills a battle hardened weapons specialist who was \u201cawarded\u201d his very own Chimera APC, and two death world Kriegsmen who decide to play up their characters cultural customs. By that I mean they went so far as to wave around their shovels every couple of minutes and refer to themselves by their numbers instead of their names. There was 11 and 36, with the latter\u2019s avatar being a girl. With such a delicious background it was no surprise that the interrogator in charge of our group turned out to be another death worlder straight out of Krieg, one going by the name of Colonel Addas, whose love of jumping straight into combat could only be matched by his mighty shovel. Above Colonel interrogator Addas we had his proactive superior, aka our superior, a full blooded, honest to the god emperor, with all the honors that accompanied it, inquisitor who also has a love of gas masks. Minus the silver hair, her getup made her look a lot like Bertha from resident Evil operation racoon city, so we all decided just to call her Inquisitor Bertha. \n\nNow aboard Inquisitor Bertha\u2019s light cruiser, our group of isekiaed misfits where introduced to the mission that would take place on a planet known for its marauding population of highly violent gangers. And by introduction, I mean a quick debriefing that took place inside Inquisitor Bertha\u2019s personal interrogation chambers. It was a dark 20 by 20 cell with enough highly polished torture equipment, chains, and an operating table to let us get a picture into what sort of inquisitor we were placed under and what would happen if we failed. God-Emperor preserve us, the woman and her death corps interrogator revealed a dire tale that involved low level gangs within Necromunda acquiring weapons that were manufactured and \u201cblessed\u201d by the forces of chaos. It was now our job to locate who exactly was manufacturing these weapons and make sure that it ended before the whole entire Hiveworld was filled to the brim with a daemonic horde of drugged crazed gangers that not even the small planetary detachment of Imperial fist space marines would be able to stop.\n\nNow our options on how to handle this holy mission was railroaded into one of two options, the first involved one team getting the honor of going into the under hive to swim among the poor wretches of Necromunda society and attempt to discover where those chaos weapons were being made while not having our souls ripped out to feed the dark gods or stabbed over having shoes not made of the discarded wrappers from the local ration bar brand. The second path involved us going into the well-kept, clean hive palace of the planetary nobles to enjoy food, music, and luxury of a far higher standard than we were all used to while dealing with the dangerous environment of political back stabbings in order to locate a possible connection with the ruling families and the sudden surge of chaos weaponry. Lord Daimen, with eagerness, cunning and absolute bravery decided to volunteer the group to handle the nobles, an easy and comfortable avenue that the high born pysker could easily navigate through and prevent us from falling into any political pitfalls. Unfortunately for our overly posh noble, Colonel interrogator Addas demanded the honor of leading us into the greatest region of gang based violence to hunt down answers and die in the name of the emperor while Inquisitor Bertha\u2019s more senior entourage could handle the dinner parties and all of the things that the death worlder found to be a cowardice waste of time. Of the two it seemed Inquisitor Bertha found the death worlder to have a more persuasive tone than our common sense driven high born psyker, a great regret for all of us.\n\nAnd so that is how our group found ourselves within a heavily armed and armored personal carrier, navigating our way through one of the most dangerous places in the galaxy second only to a death world, the eye of terror, and wherever the hell the tyranids came from. As our group sat in awkward silence for a bit longer than any of us wanted, Rajah recommended that the group get in contact with the local Arbites and see if we can find some information relating to our mission from them. A smart tactic that even our interrogator begrudgingly agreed with since we could probably end up fighting cultists sooner with some Arbite support, than spend hours trying to find a giant metaphorical flashing sign offering to sell chaos weapons in exchange for your immortal soul.\n\nOnce we parked our APC right outside the nearest arbite station, our group marched in united and confident enough to attempt whatever great undertaking had presented itself. As the group interrogator shows his inquisitorial rosette, before marching through the precinct\u2019s halls, our Krieg companion going by the number of 36 had to excuse herself to use the little interrogators room. Immediately our group went and split up, with the rest of us marching straight into the office of an Arbites Sergeant. A grizzled battle hardened Arbite who had seen a lot of things, but never did he expect to see the Emperor\u2019s holy inquisition barging into his office.\n\nUpon meeting this veteran Arbite, we requested some information regarding the gang wars and the discovery of the taint of chaos, a matter that even the Arbites seem to have taken an interest in. Though their full might was reserved on dealing with the larger gangs that inhabit Necromunda\u2019s low hive levels, the news that small gangs were given warp touched weaponry and running amok destroying other small gangs and swallowing them up was quite interesting. Two among these gangs seemed to have risen quite high for a time, the Van Dimes and Graffters, the first being a firearm obsessed gang and the latter being some back alley tech fetishists that attempted to style themselves as ganger Tech Priests. The damage these two gangs caused was so horrid and ritualistic that the Arbites where planning to mobilize in full force to deal with them. That was until a third gang came out of the blue and absolutely wiped out the savagely barbaric chaos touched gangs, with what the arbite specialists claimed to involve low yield melta bombs and well positioned vantage points. The absolute level of damage that was inflicted upon the Van Dimes and Graffters was to such a point that the few survivors preferred Arbite custody than to remain on the streets to be hunted by some secret group.\n\nWe used our most talented inquiry tactics to get more information from the Arbite regarding this third gang, but as soon as we learned that they were calling themselves the Cabal, some of our more lore friendly 21sters started sweating out bullets. The Cabal of the Warhammer lore involved a massive group of immortal xenos united to stop chaos at all cost\u2026 and that cost involved Chaos taking an extremely dependent control of humanity, which would then result in mankind plunging itself into an extinction war which would also doom Chaos to follow soon after us. That was the plan of some insanely retarded aliens, who we all began believing that they had somehow escaped Eldrad\u2019s genocidal fury, and have now returned, creating chaos gangs, then hunting them when they failed to meet whatever evil plan the Cabal had going for this poor planet. Immediately we all started to ask a series of questions on where we might be able to find this Cabal gang, and where the Arbites suspected these heretical weapons were coming from, but an issue of cultural differences soon came to the forefront.\n\nYou see the Arbites of Necromunda are heavily pressed on every side, just like the imperium at large, many heroic figures had thrown their lives at stopping the gangs and mutants of Necromunda from causing massive damage and all out panic on the planet with little in the ways of proper compensation. So every bit of information and clues gathered by the Arbites were to be kept safe and protected in the case it reaches whatever gang the Arbites planned to deliver the Emperor\u2019s justice upon, that is of course if the gang in question decides to repent and offer a nice donation to the fine men and women of the Necromunda\u2019s branch of the Adeptus Arbites. This lowly Sergeant of the Arbites had offered much in the way of free information, but anymore would spit upon those proud colleagues who could not be here today and so demanded tribute in their place.\n\nWe as a collective group looked at the literal living pay wall before us, who silently extended out an open palm waiting for the grease that the all-important squeaky wheel needed. Most turned to Lord Daimen, our resident noble, AKA money bags, only to learn that our group nobleman was just as poor as the rest of us. When we questioned how that had happened, we found out the Nobleman had paid off some Adeptus Adminstratum clerk to quickly requisition his current war gear. The first being the Emperor\u2019s wrath manifested in the form of a normal human size bolter and the second being an ancestorial sword of the Everbright Family.\n\nDaimen called it Brightflame, it was something quite precious to him that had just been returned to the hands of the Everbright\u2019s after a millennia\u2019s time long thought lost. One crummy sword that looked more like an antique piece that you hang on the wall instead of the murder tool you need to survive in the 41st millennium. Yet, this serpentine, gold hilted, black blade was some trinket that his avatar\u2019s noble family had lost, only for the damn thing to be found in some dusty armory, that Daimen had just ran across during his time in the Vostroyan First born. A literal week before his character had been recruited into the inquisition. To make matters worse for he who we all thought to be the wallet of the group, the damn nobleman hadn\u2019t been paid since joining the inquisition, whose organizational belief in their acolytes surviving their first mission was so bleak none of them needed to be paid until after the mission was over.\n\nTaking a deep sigh the group collectively turned away from Lord Daimen and stared at Colonel Interrogator Addas, who getting the hint, started to rummage through his coat pockets looking for some thrones. As the Interrogator went about this, Lord Daimen had a sudden sensation of inadequacy, him a noble child of terra, a representative straight out of the cradle of humanity\u2019s elite, a psyker with might of untold power, and a mortal of the 2nd millennia with more meta knowledge than the rest of us, was unable to help his poor peasant companions accomplish our much needed goals. That was something that tore at Daimen\u2019s very fabric, his nerd like ego must have raged to such a point that it may have caused a new warp predator with an extreme dislike of failure to come into existence and haunt the posh princeling. Just as the Interrogator Addas pulled out a nice little bribe, Daimen strode forward, beaming with determination, attempting to \u201csave the day\u201d by persuading the Arbite sergeant with a heartfelt speech focusing upon his honor, his sense of civic duty, and desire to see him become the shining beacon of virtue that the great imperium needs by giving us that information for free. What happened next would be placed forever upon the poor poor foolish nobleman who for an instant forgot what universe he was sent to. We all looked at the veteran Arbite who just took a moment to contemplate what he just heard, before shaking his head and offering a heart filled smile, soon followed with him extending out his other palm for double his original asking price. You know to help him find some honor and be able to afford the expense associated with becoming that shining beacon of virtue that all within the Necromunda\u2019s branch of the Adeptus Arbites could come to respect.\n\nSeeing this our Interrogator strode forward with his own smile hidden behind his gas mask, cutting off anything else that Daimen had to say, and reached into his pocket for what we all thought would be another bribe. Instead the Krieger manhandled the massive Arbite, pulled out a heavy stub pistol and placed it underneath the chin of the Arbite Sergeant, all while being inside of said Arbite\u2019s office, which was inside of a heavily armed precinct, deep in the under belly of the infamous, *people such us as go missing all the time*, Necromunda Hive city. The mad Krieger in his most respectable and politely tone, first asked Daimen to put up a sound proof barrier, then offered an even more compassionate request this time to the Arbite to share his juicy info on the Cabal, but things are just not that easy. Never may one say that the Arbites, the lords of Order, the enforcers of the Emperor\u2019s laws, would ever be cowed by threats to their lives. No, this was a seasoned Arbite who had seen to the judgement of a hundred and thirty-nine criminal gangers within his first month on the force. He had fought scrap metal infused criminals and seven armed mutant abominations on a biweekly basis, why would some uppity yahoo from some nuclear radiated dump have the right.. NO.. the damn audacity, to dare threaten the LAW. With a short speech far more intense than that of Lord Daimen\u2019s, the Arbite Sergeant made it clear that we would not get shit from him and that we would be absolutely crazy to think that the Interrogator could kill him and ge\u2026.. BLAM.\n\nWe all looked in horror as the Arbite Sergeant crumpled lifeless down onto the ground while our absolutely insane interrogator walked with his blood splattered gas mask over to the late Arbite\u2019s console to look for what information he needed. As the information transferred onto his data pad, the rest of us looked on as the interrogator threw half of his gun into the garbage chute of the deceased Arbite before rushing off stealthily to throw the other half into a far off chute. As he returned, we all decided shit was about to hit the fan and we needed a distraction big enough to get us all safely out of here and into our APC. Daimen Everbright again decided to offer his aid, this time swearing there was no way he could fail at all and decided to use a special ability of his that he got once entering into this Grim Dark Nightmare. Within his psionic arsenal, a new, never before ability of Technomancy was added into the grim dark future of mankind. An ability that not only allowed Daimen to speak with the children of the Void dragon, but also to outright command the machine spirits to do his bidding. What some of us hoped to be Daimen\u2019s finest hour was shockingly awarded with what could be a flash bang of disappointment, a literal, just angered the machine spirits so they decided to erupt every light panel into a massive stun the shit out of you flashbang cocktail of a distraction. Also, they informed Daimen that all of the prisoners within the precinct were released, without any of the stations defense systems to stop them. \n\nSo there we were, a couple of morons from another universe, who just had a flash bang of a technical distraction blasted straight into our faces, a dead veteran Arbite that our absolutely insane interrogator just murdered a couple steps away from us, and the whole entire station now under attack by rampaging cultist gangers that we let loose upon a handful of guards who normally dealt with a prison riot by flipping a switch to activate a defense system\u2026 that just didn\u2019t feel like it would be appropriate to turn on today.\n\nAttempting to toughen through the stunning blast, most of our group succeeded, but Rajah was the only one of us too incapacitated to do anything. Mok Glok and number 11 quickly decided to carry Rajah, allowing our group to take this opportunity to rush straight out of the Arbite Sergeant\u2019s office and directly into a squad of Arbites armed with automatic shotguns. Turns out having your light bulbs switch professions into a flash grenade was not something the Adeptus Arbites found to be legal within the lex Imperialis, so the ticked off Arbites decided now would be the time to bring violent justice upon any suspicious characters that just so happened to get in their way. The first ones they came across just so happens to be the group that had a blood stained kriegsman officer, a psyker, and two dangerously looking armed men carrying a moaning guardsmen who was screaming out that we are all screwed.\n\nThinking fast on his feet, and putting as much deceit that a high ranking noble like him was famous for, our little lord Daimen somewhat redeemed himself by pointing in a random direction and screaming out \u201cHeretics, we are under attack by Heretics, they murdered the Sergeant, quickly dispense the Emperor\u2019s justice.\u201d To our surprise, Daimen\u2019s the most, it actually worked, with the squad of Arbites running off in all directions looking for a murderous heretical scumbag that just gunned down their shining beacon of departmental hope. With little else stopping us, we quickly rushed through the Arbite station, down several flights of stairs and stayed away from any hallways that explosions and firefights occurred in. As we navigated through the absolute chaos, Daimen decided now would be the best time to again use his Technomancy ability to ensure no video recorded evidence of our visit existed. What should have been a terrible idea that failed epically and earned the Noble the most degrading nickname that the rest of the group would have him wear until the emperor walked off his golden throne and said otherwise, was instead given another surprisingly successful twist of luck. The result of his Techno-magical command resulted in every bit of our time in the precinct being deleted with all backup vox vids being sent directly into interrogator Addas\u2019s data pad without a trace to link us to this whole entire mess. With what little Subtlety left intact, we all made our way out of the precinct, down onto the streets, soon packing into our chimera and racing off unharmed into the underhive.\n\nIt was at this point number 36 was finished in the rest room, only to come out to a darkened hallway filled with stunned gangers and arbites battling it out to the death. Taking out her shovel, 36 forced her way down the fastest route she could carve out, only to see us racing off to fight the Cabal without her. She would have been pissed had it not been for an aerial Arbite troop flyer taking off from the precinct\u2019s landing pad and going after our APC with extreme prejudice.\n\nMeanwhile in the luxurious halls of Lord Governor Gerontius Helmawr\u2019s palace, the governor was \u201cenjoying\u201d a pleasant night hosting a party for many of the boot lickers and kowtowed ambitious worms of his planet. The insufferable lot went about gossiping and indulging in the many delicacies that the governor had shipped from off world to hopefully delight his guest of honor. By his side, in a chair that was raised far higher than his own, sat one Inquisitor Bertha of the order Hereticus and her colorful entourage of interrogators. The assembled host of inquisitorial power did not entangle themselves with other nobles, nor actively inquired about the heretical threat that the Governor had called them all in on. The only thing the Emperor\u2019s holy agents would do, was sit quietly, watch everyone, while occasionally eating and drinking anything Lord Governor Helmawr would partake in first. There was very little that the governor could do to make his guests feel more accommodated under his roof, for the inquisitorial team that he had requested to his planet only cared for one thing and one thing only. He could see it in their Inquisitor\u2019s eyes, the sight of an Apex predator, actively seeking out what ever threats that hid within the flock of arrogant sheeple that made up his court. Whenever Gerontius attempted to start a conversation with the Inquisitor, her disinterested demeanor brought about a single word response that ended any hope of dialogue. It was not until midway through the festivity that the situation took a surprising turn, Inquisitor Bertha\u2019s vox comms lit up with news from another interrogator that had been sent to scout out the under belly of his hive city for clues that may lead to the eradication of the heretical weapons dealers.\n\n\u201cColonel Addas, report.\u201d Hearing from this Kriegsman of news regarding some gang killing other gangs did not seem noteworthy, but when some Junior Inquisitorial Acolytes joined the fray, mentioning how this gang might be of possible Xeno\u2019s origins and may have played a pivotal role in supplying the chaos tainted weapons, it immediately brought a sudden silence to everyone listening in. As the location of this \u201cCabal\u201d had been transmitted over, Inquisitor Bertha ended the vox call, stood up gracefully from her high chair, and planned to make her way out to deal with what could be considered without a doubt to be HERESY. Jumping in on the opportunity to earn the favor of his better, Lord Governor Gerontius Helmawr of Necromunda insisted to divert a full company of PDF troopers and place them all under the Inquisitor\u2019s direct command to help aid her in dealing with whatever heretical force was bringing ruin to his planet. For the first time since meeting the Inquisitor, the lord Governor was shocked utterly by the simplest of smiles from Inquisitor Bertha. It was a way of thanking the Lord Governor for doing his part in protecting the imperium, and how she would put the PDF company to good use in hunting all parties responsible for this most grievous of crimes. As Bertha and her entourage walked away, the Governor sat down and did something he had never done outside of the occasional political visit to the local shrines to the Emperor. He prayed, first and foremost for the protection of his soul and life, but he soon followed it up by begging the master of mankind to not let his family\u2019s seven millennia of loyalty to the Imperium, end with the Governor\u2019s ancestral planet turning into a flaming ball of exterminatus grade residue.\n\nBack within the refurbished interior of Rajah\u2019s APC, members of our group took the time to relax in the custom leather seats and safety features bedecked all around us. An important feature that helped comfort us all at the fact that our Chimera APC, with its experimental engine, was going at such a speed it would cuck the crap out of Speed racer and his Mach Five. Though the level of speed the APC was going at was soon limited with the flow of Hive traffic, which allowed some of us to take a deep sigh of relief as we safely buckled ourselves in. For the next few moments we tried to unwind from the whole entire Arbite station debacle and rest up before we had to go into a battle that might see all of us dead or at the mercy of some idiotically sinister Xenos. However those few moments of down time was ruined as Rajah, the dazed guardsman we decided to leave in charge of manning the APC\u2019s guns instead of driving, quickly informed us that an Arbite flyer was stalking us and was quickly shortening the distance.\n\nPopping his head out of the APC gunner hatch, Lord Daimen confirmed Rajah\u2019s statement, seeing a troop assault VTOL closing in on our position. Confused as to why one would be coming after us, Daimen used some of his psyker abilities to see what was going on inside the flyer. With a magical connection quickly made, the nobleman screamed out in disgust, severing his connection to the flyer and informing the rest of the group that the Arbite VTOL was hijacked by a group of ticked off chaos cultists who were currently seeking to bring about a blood bath through dark binary chants. Immediately Rajah attempted to aim the heavy weaponry of the Chimera and take the arbite flyer down. Unfortunately, the stunning effect of the lightbulb flash bangs and the distance between the flyer and the APC was too great of a negative modifier for any chance of successfully shooting down the enemies of Mankind. It seemed the only chance we would get at shooting it down was if the Flyer came at a close enough range to also acquired the same hit chance as us. So instead of waiting for the Hijacked flyer to unleash a barrage of anti-armored missiles or a daemonic horde down upon us, Daimen decided to take a crack at it.\n\nUsing the last of his technomancy for the next 24 hours, the noble psyker attempted to command the flyer to fail in reaching us. What Lord Daimen had hoped his command would do, involved the flyer to either stop entirely or be lowered to such a point that it would hover 3 inches off of the ground and then be subjected to the same horrible Hive traffic that we were limited by. What occurred would be beyond all of our expectations, to the point that it made us all see the potential of unleashing such unimaginably overpowered machine magic might within the Warhammer setting. With but a command the heretic controlled flyer suddenly made a sharp turn upwards, spinning in several high speed spiral rotations, before plummeting to the ground in what was said to be a nose dive of such perfect divine retribution ever witnessed by man. The ensuing crash resulted in an explosion so powerful that it not only killed all chaos worshipers inside, but also slayed over a hundred innocent civilians whose vehicles failed to properly stop before adding to the ever growing body count, not to mention injuring countless more and causing what will be known as the worst traffic accident in all of Necromunda\u2019s history. To top it all off, the explosions sent out such a disastrous shock wave that our APC, a good 2 miles away was effected by it, and to make matters worse no one in all of our group had the great wisdom to question the idea of letting Mok Glok, the feral worlder, to drive a highly complicated, military grade, armored personal carrier with six pedals and only one direction it was currently plummeting towards.\n\nI mean seriously most feral worlders had customs involving kidnapping woman from a settlement far away as the normal means of acquiring a spouse, and during a drought they would beg the Sun-Emperor that they worship to deliver rain by having the population do a whole lot of psychedelics that they found growing off of a dead human and then dance in order to appease the Master of Mankind instead of whipping themselves like the civilized portions of the Imperium did. Given that all of what I said is only a step or two bellow the standard idiocy that has raked the Imperium to its core, I will give Mok Glok some slack. By some means, his origins as a feral worlder did not kick in as he expertly drove through a hive cities worth of traffic while at the same time navigating his way to a base of what will be nightmarish Xeno manipulators. A very impressive track record, whose only hiccup that I and the rest of the group had was that Mok Glok drove us over the edge\u2026 specifically the edge of the hive level we were currently on. To put that into prospective, imagine driving off of a multiple story tall skyscraper, with nothing between the top point of the building and the ground floor to halt our fall. That was exactly what falling from one level of a city hive to another was like, all because Mok Glok failed to properly take control of the vehicle. \n\nSo as the Chimera APC plummeted to the lower level with at least a dozen other vehicles whose drivers also failed to overcome the shock wave, ours was \u201cmagically\u201d designed to miraculously survive even something of this level of outright lunacy. Seriously we all should have died from this, but by the Emperor not only did Lord Daimen and Rajah expertly made their way down to buckle themselves up safely, but each and every one of us inside the APC managed to come out of this thing completely unharmed\u2026.. with the exception of the APC. To say it was totaled would be an understatement, for our one and only fortress of mobile fortitude had been bent into unrecognizable shapes as it created a massive crater within the 158th floor of the Hive City. Upon impact, any free pointed shapes of the APC was bludgeoned into a dull square box, or fell off like the threads that allowed the whole entire thing to move.\n\nClimbing out of the wreckage, we all decided it would be best to remain quiet as Rajah, immediately and without question recovered from the after effects of the magically induced flash bang, and then erupted into such an emotional rage that it allowed a daemon of khorne to come into existence somewhere within the depths of the warp. Shouting at Mok Glok that his precious APC and possibly the only safe place in all of the 40k universe was totaled, maybe even beyond repair, left the feral worlder quiet and occasionally apologizing whenever he got the chance to speak up. Outright tired with all of this, the Weapons specialist thundered over his loss as he called into the local PDF\u2019s branch of the Mechanicus to come by and pick up his most precious treasure. From there we tried to decipher where exactly our APC had landed, we knew without a doubt it was not our target destination which required us to descend another level into the hive, but outside of that there was nothing else that gave us a clue as to where we were.\n\nDeciding that we needed to drop down another level as fast as possible, our Colonel Interrogator pulled out several Lathe Pattern Jump Packs out of Emperor knows where, and demanded all of us to immediately jump off the side of the hive ledge to get to the level down below as fast as possible. It took a moment before we all registered what exactly Interrogator Addas wanted from us, or even how he materialized those jump packs. Rajah whether out of blind anger or some extreme form of melancholy, was the first to act and decided to take up the mad Interrogators insane demand to get to the bottom level the fastest way possible. The rest of us saw this insanity for what it was and refused to follow it, instead of getting shot in the face by our interrogator, the smug bastard told us we will be left behind and that we should not expect him and his ideal acolyte to return to save us from whatever gang territory we got ourselves lost in. After that both Rajah and Interrogator Addas jumped off the ledge, with Rajah somehow expertly taking control of the jump pack and using it to make a somewhat graceful landing onto the lower level. The Interrogator on the other hand, failed to maneuver or even properly activate his jump pack as he rushed off the edge and joined the ever-growing suicide rate that ran rampant in most Hive cities.\n\nLord Daimen, lacking all skills to even operate a jump pack, decided to lead the rational remaining members of the group not towards any gang rampant territories but instead to a turbo lift with access to the level that the Cabal is rumored to be hiding on. After a short ride down the vandalized elevator, Daimen, Mok Glok, and 11 arrived within the area of Rajah and the interrogator\u2019s \u201clanding\u201d. Uniting the two groups, everyone stared at the fallen Colonel who was now fused to the pavement with a splash zone that went out in a nice 3-meter-long diameter. No one among us said a word at first, not even offering a prayer, once we all came to the conclusion that this was the best thing to happen to us since arriving in the 40k universe, Lord Daimen swiftly walked up to the late Colonel Addas and started rummaging through his pockets. After a good minute, the Nobleman of the Everbright family pulled out an Inquisitorial Rosette and one slightly cracked data pad that was cushioned by Interrogator Addas\u2019s great sacrifice. At first Lord Daimen offered the Rosette to any member of the group that wanted to take up the leadership role, when no one volunteered Daimen immediately went full Star Scream declaring himself the new leader and acting interrogator of the group.\n\nWithin the first few seconds of his rise to the coveted position of Inquisitorial Interrogator, Daimen let the ambition, the stupidity, and zealous desire to immediately solidify his new self-appointed rank go straight to his head. Informing the group that he would use his mighty psychic powers to pinpoint the exact location of the heretical weapons factory, thereby cutting off the Cabal from crafting anymore weaponry while Inquisitor Bertha besieged their base and slaughtered them. He claimed it was a decent plan since the Cabal would have most of their important members far away from any tainted chaos weaponry, and those that where crafting the weapons wouldn\u2019t get any reinforcement when Inquisitor Bertha made her move. Now the only issue with his plan was locating said weapon forge, and in that Lord Daimen Everbright failed utterly and spectacularly.\n\nIn the moments he attempted to esoterically sense out his enemies, believing it to be an easy thing to locate within an imperial world, he came to the sudden realization that all of the great trauma, misery, and downright horrid living of standards of a hive not only masked the taint of chaos, it also overwhelmed the noble psyker with what could only be said to be the most horrible thing he had ever undergone, which was then followed up with a vision of calamity to come. To the rest of the group it looked like Daimen had eaten something sour causing him to at first cringe and shake, but once he started bleeding out of his mouth, nose, eyes, and ears, all the while claiming that a massive Daemonic horde would attack the planet, it did more than just unsettle everyone. As the pysker dropped down to the ground babbling more horrible predictions of the future, the rest of the group just stood there, watching the High Born twitch before going as still as Colonel Interrogator Addas. He was perfectly fine just needed some rest, but the rest of the group discussed all that occurred with their first and now second interrogator before deciding on the right course of action.\n\nRajah after checking for a pulse on Daimen, decided the best and brightest option to ensure the groups survival was to strap a ring of explosives around the High Born psyker\u2019s neck. You know for his own protection, as well as that of the rest of the group. If a daemon invasion was coming and not some sort of delusion born from whatever aneurism that Nobleman Everbright suffered, the first person they would target would be without a doubt the psyker, so this was all just a nice bit of insurance against that. After expertly segmenting a series of minor demolition charges into a bomb collar, the weapons specialist then made a vox call to Inquisitor Bertha, who had just reached the Cabal base and was nearly done conquering it. With the upmost sincerity Rajah let her know of Interrogator Colonel Addas\u2019s tragic accident and how incredibly sorry he was to lose such a special man. What we got in the form of a response was not something anyone of us expected.\n\n\u201cDamn it, not again Addas, scrape him up and bring him to me. And never call me while I\u2019m busy.\u201d After hanging up and leaving us all stunned by her short statement that birth a thousand conspiracy theories ranging from a daemon host to some foul necromantic boga boga bullshit to explain what she meant by her one off comment. Doing as the inquisitor said, we scraped up the Colonel, and carried Daimen. Mid way through our trip to the Cabal base, we soon came to realize what Inquisitor Bertha meant by not again. In the 6 hours we spent lugging both Daimen and what remained of Interrogator Addas, none of us noticed the Colonel slowly knitting himself together and return to his perpetually insane healthy self. That was a clear shock to all of us who knew that no new perpetuals had existed since the 31st millennia\u2026 until now. Whoever\u2019s idea it was to make a Death Corps of Krieg Colonel into a perpetual was as mad as our revived Interrogator, who fell off of 11\u2019s shovel, landed on his feet, spread out his hands, and exclaim in jolly joy at his successful landing with the Jump Pack.", "LMAO YOU HAD MAX COSMETICS AND GOT LIKE THE 2ND BEST LEGENDARY LLLLLLLL", "I wouldn't recommend GE Proton for warframe.

GER nerfed her significantly so she healed less often.\n\nKanon I mostly hate because there was a duo mission with her where you had to fight a Quadriga (might have been Fallen?) where she kept knocking me out of the air while I was trying to break the missile pods **from the other side of the aragami**.", "Tbh every item on the Battle Pass makes the 2500 GE spent worth it more than the T10A (SL boosters and the like)\n\nBut for grinding Russia, the T10 is fine, it won't be a seal clubber but it can hold its own with a battle stabilizer and its still very capable 122mm cannon.", "Free GE app sounds like the Scam bruddah", "It does work. But i'd steer clear of the surveys. They are run by a different company than the offers.\n\nThe offers are run by tapjoy and do pay out. However they can be very misleading in what is required.\n\n Sometimes there is a less than obvious time frame or a misleading description in what is needed to be done.\n\nAlso the automatic awards don't always kick in. So you need to chase the company via email. If you need to do this make sure it is within 7 days of any timeframe. I have had a reply for a seperate problem just outside of the required timeframe and been denied the award.\n\nAll that said. I have, to date,  earned about 11K GE from the app.", "Well these are the stocks i like and in this specific order, unless it's a Monday following a 4-day trading week, if the 12th of the month falls on a Thursday or it's after-hours market in which case you reverse all the ticker symbols and then those are the stocks I like:\n\nMGM, MCHP, MU, MSFT, SWKS, SLG, SNA, SO, LUV, SWK, SBUX, STT, STE, SYK, SIVB, SYF, SNPS, SYY, TMUS, TROW, TTWO, TPR, TGT, TEL, FTI, TFX, TXN, TXT, TMO, TIF, TJX, TSCO, TDG, TRV, TFC, TWTR, TSN, UDR, ULTA, USB, UAA, UA, UNP, UAL, UNH, UPS, URI, UTX, UHS, UNM, VFC, VLO, VAR, VTR, VRSN, VRSK, VZ, VRTX, VIAC, V, VNO, VMC, WRB, WAB, WMT, WBA, DIS, WM, WAT, WEC, WFC, WELL, WDC, WU, WRK, WY, WHR, WMB, WLTW, WYNN, XEL, XRX, XLNX, XYL, YUM, ZBRA, ZBH, ZION, ZTS MMM, ABT, ABBV, ABMD,  AVY, BKR, BLL, BAC, BK, BAX, BDX, BRK.B, BBY, BIIB, BLK, BA, BKNG, BWA, BXP, BSX, BMY, AVGO, BR, BF.B, CHRW, COG, CDNS, CPB, COF, CPRI, CAH, KMX, CCL, CAT, CBOE, CBRE, CDW, CE, CNC, CNP, CTL, CERN, CF, SCHW, CHTR, CVX, CMG, CB, CHD, CI, XEC, CINF, CTAS, CSCO, C, CFG, CTXS, CLX, CME, CMS, KO, CTSH, CL, CMCSA, CMA, CAG, CXO, COP, ED, STZ, COO, CPRT, GLW, CTVA, COST, COTY, CCI, CSX, CMI, CVS, DHI, DHR, DRI, DVA, DE, DAL, XRAY, DVN, FANG, DLR, DFS, DISCA, DISCK, DISH, DG, DLTR, D, DOV, DOW, DTE, DUK, DRE, DD, DXC, ETFC, EMN, ETN, EBAY, ECL, EIX, EW, EA, EMR, ETR, EOG, EFX, EQIX, EQR, ESS, EL, EVRG, ES, RE, EXC, EXPE, EXPD, EXR, XOM, FFIV, FB, FAST, FRT, FDX, FIS, FITB, FE, FRC, FISV, FLT, FLIR, FLS, FMC, F, FTNT, FTV, FBHS, FOXA, FOX, BEN, FCX, GPS, GRMN, IT, GD, GE, GIS, GM, GPC, GILD, GL, GPN, GS, GWW, HRB, HAL, HBI, HOG, HIG, HAS, HCA, PEAK, HP, HSIC, HSY, HES, HPE, HLT, HFC, HOLX, HD, HON, HRL, HST, HPQ, HUM, HBAN, HII, IEX, IDXX, INFO, ITW, ILMN, IR, INTC, ICE, IBM, INCY, IP, IPG, IFF, INTU, ISRG, IVZ, IPGP, IQV, IRM, JKHY, J, JBHT, SJM, JNJ, JCI, JPM, JNPR, KSU, K, KEY, KEYS, KMB, KIM, KMI, KLAC, KSS, KHC, KR, LB, LHX, LH, LRCX, LW, LVS, LEG, LDOS, LEN, LLY, LNC, LIN, LYV, LKQ, LMT, L, LOW, LYB, MTB, M, MRO, MPC, MKTX, MAR, MMC, MLM, MAS, MA, MKC, MXIM, MCD, MCK, MDT, MRK, MET, MTD, MAA, MHK, TAP, MDLZ, MNST, MCO, MS, MOS, MSI, MSCI, MYL, NDAQ, NOV, NTAP, NFLX, NWL, NEM, NWSA, NWS, NEE, NLSN, NKE, NI, NBL, JWN, NSC, NTRS, NOC, NLOK, NCLH, NRG, NUE, NVDA, NVR, ORLY, OXY, ODFL, OMC, OKE, ORCL, PCAR, PKG, PH, PAYX, PAYC, PYPL, PNR, PBCT, PEP, PKI, PRGO, PFE, PM, PSX, PNW, PXD, PNC, PPG, PPL, PFG, PG, PGR, PLD, PRU, PEG, PSA, PHM, PVH, QRVO, PWR, QCOM, DGX, RL, RJF, RTN, O, REG, REGN, RF, RSG, RMD, RHI, ROK, ROL, ROP, ROST, RCL, SPGI, CRM, SBAC, SLB, STX, SEE, SRE, NOW, SHW, SPG, ACN, ATVI, ADBE, AMD, AAP, AES, AFL, A, APD, AKAM, ALK, ALB, ARE, ALXN, ALGN, ALLE, AGN, ADS, LNT, ALL, GOOGL, GOOG, MO, AMZN, AMCR, AEE, AAL, AEP, AXP, AIG, AMT, AWK, AMP, ABC, AME, AMGN, APH, ADI, ANSS, ANTM, AON, AOS, APA, AIV, AAPL, AMAT, APTV, ADM, ARNC, ANET, AJG, AIZ, ATO, T, ADSK, ADP, AZO, AVB.  \n\n\nEdit: i am not a financial professional...i don't lose enough money to be considered one yet", "I copy pasted those stock tickers and posted.

For the life and physical sciences, note that the many of the popular GEs in those categories, like LS 15 or the lower-div Astro/EPSS courses, don't count toward their respective majors. LS 15 is an awesome class, but don't think that you are behind because you didn't take it. However, science majors have more course requirements than north campus, so that's something to consider when planning schedules.", "In that case I\u2019d do 13S, Math 21 since it\u2019s Cooperstein, and a GE", "I asked the same thing in the thread that was cross-posted to /r/SmartThings.  My guess is that it's just going to happen again.\n\nOn the plus side, capacitors are cheap.  If the process doesn't take too long I'd be OK doing this a couple times.  Getting only 2 years out of a $40 switch is unacceptable.  6-10 years isn't great, but I can swallow it.  By that time I'm probably upgrading to something else.  That said, I only have a couple of the non-Z-wave+, non-dimming models, which it appears like this failure is predominately in.  If all 40+ of my GE switches did this every 2-3 years I'd be pissed.", "Noting this thread for future reference. I only have one GE Zwave switch, which I bought several years ago and never got around to installing (but will soon). So many dead electronics with bad caps that I've been able to revive with some simple soldering...", "I've found that when I had grow lights over my monstera, their leaves stretched upwards and looked really weird. I have since bought one of the GE par 38s and I have it pointing AT my monstera from the side and the leaves have come down and look much nicer", "I use that light! Just swapped to one in Dec and my plants have gone nuts. I have a monstera deliciosa, adansonii, silver bay, BOP, and a few cuttings that have done fairly well. Super happy with the GE PAR38.", "People already do that with the current system. In fact, I think the current system encourages that even more than the one I propose.\n\nIf people are forced to do GEs and yet GEs cannot be used to fulfill subject (let's use this as a general term for degree/major/minor) requirements, then there's no incentive to take harder GEs. Most would just opt to take an easy GE that is useful to them, and the only useful effect is pulling up their CAP so yea.\n\nOn the other hand, if there were no GEs and they were just UEs, they have the additional effect where they can be used for subject requirements. This means there's some incentive to take harder mods, not just mods that help to pull up their CAP, because it can help meet subject requirements, which usually require harder higher-level modules.\n\nAlso, there's the 60 MC limit on level 1 modules as well as vacancy limits for all mods including those easier mods which helps to reduce the number of people taking those easier mods (which tend to be level 1) to get a higher CAP.\n\nAnother alternative is to just do what UK unis and I think some other European unis do which is to just remove GEs and UEs and allow their students to get a bachelor's degree in 3 years, master's degree in 4 years. This would get rid of this CAP manipulation problem and allow us to graduate earlier which is especially good for guys, because they already graduate later due to NS. The downside is that people cannot take second subjects.", "I mean I guess that makes some sense. Interdisciplinary stuff would definitely actually create modules that actually force subjects (let's use this as a general term for degree/major/minor) to be integrated together. Is it really helpful or necessary though? I wrote a longer post why I don't think this is the case but I didn't want to come across as angry or ranty or weird so here's a shorter version lol:\n\nBy forcing these interdisciplinary curriculum, students would have to sacrifice on depth of knowledge. The fact that students can take more than one subject should be sufficient for breadth. Using up mods for GEs (especially ones focused on interdisciplinary thinking which will likely do not focus on depth) means less depth, it would be better to minimise them.\n\nAlso, taking two subjects that are complementary don't really need interdisciplinary-thinking-focused mods to make it explicit how to integrate them together. If they are already complementary, it's unnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, taking two subjects that pretty much don't mix at all should not be forced to be integrated for the sake of interdisciplinary thinking. If they are just not meant to be integrated, there is no need to force it.\n\nEven if all my points are wrong and interdisciplinary stuff is better no matter what, is it really necessary to force it on all students? Why not merely leave it as an option?", "Why Mech Eng? The IDP is sufficient for students who like design. It should be an option, not something forced on the main curriculum. As a Mech Eng student, I feel like our curriculum is already inferior compared to those from other unis. They've reduced the number of core Mech Eng modules to make space for UEs, GEs, and even the engineering core modules (of which not all are relevant to Mech Eng) in the latest curriculum change. I feel like we already learn less than students from other unis and as a result, we are less capable engineers. If they force this further curriculum change, we'll have even less space for Mech Eng core modules and we'll further learn a lot less. This change would be bad for Mech Eng IMO, and probably even for all engineering disciplines.", "I don't know the technical specifics of why, but cheap microwaves suck. I bought my mom like a $800 GE microwave like 12+ years ago when I worked at Best Buy as a side gig because of the discount, and it's still the best, most powerful, evenly heating microwave I've ever used. \n\nThe cheap ones usually take forever to heat something and explode food with the hotspot right in the middle even with a rotating platter. Go ahead and buy a cheap one if you hate yourself and your family, but a microwave isn't something to cheap out on... and I cheap out on a lot.", "I agree with this. As a mech Engg too, I can't believe we have to do all those GEs, they should let us do more TEs. But I should've been more clearer in my statement earlier. What I meant to say was that some mech Engg studs are interested in designing parts, so I wouldn't mind doing a couple modules from SDE, but it's personal preference and should be an option. \n\nI've felt IDP focused more on turning an idea into a product rather than designing it in depth. IDP is more of managing a project and designing is like showing what you believe a product should be like. Both are necessary, but not the same.

In particular, it would just occasionally grind to a halt (not just in the menu, but also with level changes, etc.). I was never able to completely rid myself of that issue, but I did get it to decrease in frequency enough to put up with it.

I tried multiple versions of Proton, but what I completed the game with was `5.21-GE-1`. I installed the 32bit mesa vulkan package, but I think that was just for getting the Origin client to work (the Origin client was harder to get past than any of the bosses or puzzles in the game itself). I turned down a lot of the graphics, and turned off the Steam overlay.\n\nMy run command was:\n\n    export PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1; export DXVK_ASYNC=1; %command%\n\nI think the asynchronous pipelines helped, but maybe it was just that shader cache was already built up by the time I tested it.\n\n&gt;  I have tried Proton 5.21-GE-1 and Proton 6.0-GE-1 and both do the same thing... after title screen is displayed I get a nice green glitched out matrix looking full screen. Stays there for about 30s then crashes to desktop.\n\nDid you blow away the wine prefix made by 5.13 before running with the newer Proton versions? I think 5.13 was the version that had an issue with borking the prefix in a way that caused issues with Media Foundation stuff. Since the issue is happening right about the time a video should be playing, maybe that's it. In any case, it's a good idea to blow away prefixes when changing versions just to make sure there's no cruft left behind causing issues.", "Yeah I deleted the game and physically removed both the game folder and compdata folder.  It takes quite a while to test multiple versions of proton when doing it this way as well, since it will often trigger Origins \"too many logins\" \"feature\" and lock you out for a full 24 hours.\n\nBoth the GE Protons I tried resulted in the green glitchy screen and the CTD.   Only the Steam 5.13 will work.

For example, let's say you only need WR 39C *(in the case AP exam scores exempt you from WR 39A &amp; WR 39B)* to complete your low-division writing GE requirement, meaning that you will be done with it in one quarter. In the case you decide to opt-in CHC you WILL HAVE TO complete the year-long HUMCORE sequence. Sure you'll get multiple GEs out of the way but there are other courses you can take that satisfy multiple GE requirements *(e.g. SOCIOL 1 satisfies GE requirements 3 and 7)*\n\nTake this info with a grain of salt though.

Many of us know the feeling of giving into this game a lot od our time And compete in skill groups to get ourselfs feeling of achieving something beyond our own skill. The game involves mindset, communication, reflexes And knowledge od there game. Valve has possibilities to make this game almost immortal in eyes off comunity if they Can find a way to get involved with their players and listen to them, their needs and wants.\n\nThe idea is that rather the pointless operations in which we actualy go away from the core of the game we could get something that could embrace the soul od CS GO and its competitive nature. If Valve can create actual working anti-cheat system that could find people cheat in this game even if they use support of third party partners like Faceit/ESEA and make it happen, then many players would be encouraged to try again in game matchmaking.\n\nNext step for greatness would be an implementation of statistics which Can get pretty detailed, into skill groups. But as we all know, skill is based on many factors and stats can help to get better a\u0165 the game because one can learn what is there to change in playstyle to get better. Which gives me idea that if Valve loves the game like so many players because of the game itself and not only because of the numbers its produce, then if they invest time and resources to give this game new breath of life in form of actualy rewarding players for playing game. They could introduce for highest rank in competitive game an elo/MMR ratings visble to players and leaderboard. In which they could compete for monthly prices maybe even for some form of items which rarity would be insane. So players on GE would get motivated to play matchmaking again, as well as introduce 128 tick servers for those players involved in leaderboard matchmaking. Games for leaderboard could be set to something like 2-3 games a day so 3rd parties like Faceit ESEA would not lose their players, but people would get rewarded for playng game. And as there are stars for which we can open skins they could give new colection of skins for each season which could be opend not only for money but as well for some form of points from matchmaking.\n\nIf you like this idea you can upvote it so it gets into the comunity and maybe at some point to Valve itself.

You know, if e.g. US makes 10M, FR makes 7M, GER/ITA make 4M (imaginary numbers) and others make like 100-500k at most for example, then combinining the top 4 grossing countries would add up to 25M compared to the ~100-500k from some other countries, so the top 4 in my example would be maybe a total of 60-70% of the income, which could give a decent idea. That is, if the majority of the income only comes from a few countries (and thus just checking 2-3 countries could be doable). \n\nOr maybe just find the top grossing one and make some (big) extrapolations (as I think the behaviour of players would be more or less similar across the year, regardless of their country).

The current paradigm increases the price of items as more of them are purchased. While this has some benefits of making it more difficult to buy items in bulk, the mechanic is completely bypassed by more world hopping. A better system would be to have all bulk items (i.e., rune packs) be more expensive than items sold individually. This would do a couple of beneficial things:\n\n- Players who want to spend less money can buy items individually and world hop\n- Players who have excess money can purchase items in packs without affecting GE prices\n- Greatly reduces the amount of world hopping necessary\n- Keeps the shop and skilling mechanics focused on the actual gameplay rather than on spending hours world hopping to accomplish the same thing \n- Reduces the impact of bots", "You can take one or two at a time.

It has purpose, on the tron chain, trades quick and cheap, and has the capacity to make a lot of people rich.  \n4. TRX : as BTT, WINK, FREE, and other TRON coins grow, so will TRX.  It's so ridiculously undervalued in my opinion.  Call JS a shitposter all you want, he wouldn't throw his ass out on the line like that if he didn't believe in the end product.\n5. XRP : just wait.  When the lawsuits are over, and CB picks it pack up, it will skyrocket.  Who remembers when the rumor of a CB listing propelled XRP from $0.40 to $3.60 in a day?  If more people had the ability to buy XRP right now, they would.  \n6. XLM : because it will follow XRP.  It's got it's own thing going for it, and when the whole blockchain thing goes mainstream, someone will pick up Stellar and keep it's place at the top of the food chain.\n7. LTC : people have been involved in LTC almost as long as BTC.  And they've been holding bags for years, and they're not selling.  It will ride the coat tales of BTC / ETH, with some ebb and flow, and continue to make gains for the sole reason the old timers are sentimental about their LTC, and not parting with it until they're rich.

For example i took AP calc and got credit so i didn\u2019t have to take a class for GE F. You also need to take two classes in category B and C but i don\u2019t remember if there are any ap classes that can give you credit for those. As for your second question, the only thing i know is that if an AP class didn\u2019t waive a requirement, it can still help you get an earlier registration time! Also, depending on your major, AP credits can possibly help you waive an intro course. i was able to waive PSYC 100 because i got credit for AP psych", "Answer 1: GE-A requires 1 class\nGE-B requires 2 classes\nGE-C requires 2 classes\nGE-D requires 1 class\nGE-E requires 1 class\nGE-F requires 1 class\nGE-G requires 1 class (overlaps with either B or C)\nGE-H requires 1 class (overlaps with either B or C)\nAny 1 of the listed AP classes can wave 1 class in its specified GE category, so it\u2019ll get the GE requirement waved. USC will take up to 8 AP exams of 4 or 5 like you mentioned, which equates to 32 credits, or 1 academic year. They\u2019ll accept the scores that fill GE requirements first, and then just take random scores until the 8 scores max is reached. Also scores that count for GE credit will also give you 4 elective credits, so they count in that 32 credit max.\nAnswer 2: Pretty much yea. Any class that doesn\u2019t count for a GE requirement will just count as 4 elective credits. The only good thing about getting those elective credits is that you can max out the 32 limit, come in as a sophomore in academic standing, and get earlier class registration times. So for your AP Lit, if you\u2019ve already reached the max 32 credits, there\u2019s no real point in taking it, same for other AP tests that won\u2019t test you out of GE requirements.\nAlso important to note that once you start your first semester, you HAVE to take GE classes at USC. You can\u2019t, for instance, take courses at a community college during the summer and have them fulfill GE requirements, only major requirements. So it\u2019s important to take the AP test that will give you GE credit, and take 1 or 2 summer classes BEFORE you start in the fall to fill up as many GE requirements as you can.\nHope this helps!", "For Q1: The amount of credit needed for each category varies between credit for either one or two courses depending on the specific category. You should look up GE requirements for USC students enrolled in 2015 or later for more info, but I believe it\u2019s laid out something like this:\n\nGE-A: The Arts (one course)\n\nGE-B: Humanistic Inquiry (two courses)\n\nGE-C: Social Analysis (two courses)\n\nGE-D: Life Sciences (one course)\n\nGE-E: Physical Sciences (one course)\n\nGE-F: Quantitative Reasoning (one course)\n\n\n\nStudents must complete one course for each of the two Global Perspectives requirements:\n\nGlobal Perspectives:\n\nGE-G: Citizenship in a Diverse World (one course)\n\nGE-H: Traditions and Historical Foundations (one course)\n\nAt USC some GE courses can double-count for G or H as well as one of the A-F categories. I do not know how this works with AP tests. Bottom line is if you take something like Calc AB and get a 4 or 5, you can send that in and be done with your GE-F requirement. You may need two relevant tests for categories with two-course requirements.\n\nFor Q2: Coming in with credit can be beneficial because it can \u201celevate\u201d your class standing. For example, if you send in 8 exams with 4s or 5s, you will have 32 units of elective credit (4 per exam) already in your account. The system will therefore treat you like you have already completed two semesters at USC, and elevate your registration time as such. This is because registration times are assigned based on the numbers of units students have in their accounts. So it\u2019s mainly just helpful for getting an earlier registration time, which helps to ensure that you can get the classes/professors you want.\n\nIf you already have more than 8 exams and the exams you\u2019re taking don\u2019t satisfy any specific course waiver requirements or GE requirements, it is technically not \u201cworth\u201d it to take the exam in the sense that it won\u2019t benefit you once you\u2019re enrolled here. However, while it\u2019s up to you I personally didn\u2019t really see any point in studying for a class all year just to end up skipping the exam at the end.", "1.

Yes according to [https://arr.usc.edu/services/articulation/adv\\_placement\\_exam\\_credit.html](https://arr.usc.edu/services/articulation/adv_placement_exam_credit.html). The point is you don't have to give U$C as much money and you get better registration times (kinda, a lot of students come in with max or close to max AP/IB transfer credits). So no, it's not worth taking AP Lit unless you just like taking the exams for the hell of it", "What everyone else has said, plus I haven\u2019t seen this, but you also need to take a GESM, a seminar, as one of your GE\u2019s.

In my defense, I had a college final that I had to take in a class I was borderline for directly after it so I knew that If I spent my energy on the essays, I would be brain dead for the final. Doesn\u2019t hurt to do your best, chances are you get some AP scholar award, but the way I see it, not needing to use ap lit for credit means that you don\u2019t have to stress about doing amazing and can focus on other courses that need your attention", "Team: Blue\n\nPrimary Color: D4\n\nPrimary Paint Finish: Goop GE\n\nAccent Color: G1\n\nAccent Paint Finish: Goop GE\n\nDesign Submitted By: u/Get_Me_Out_Of_Gold\n\nForm Link: https://git.io/JO0Xh", "Team: Orange\n\nPrimary Color: D8\n\nPrimary Paint Finish: Goop GE\n\nAccent Color: G1\n\nAccent Paint Finish: Goop GE\n\nDesign Submitted By: u/Get_Me_Out_Of_Gold\n\nForm Link: https://git.io/JO01f", "Team: Blue\n\nPrimary Color: G8\n\nPrimary Paint Finish: Goop GE\n\nAccent Color: D9\n\nAccent Paint Finish: Goop GE\n\nDesign Submitted By: u/Jager619\n\nForm Link: https://git.io/JOEvc", "Date: April 18, 2011  \nTitle: People are angry the GE did not pay US taxes, but GE did not break any US tax laws.

His debut has him tick all the boxes, but he never makes the role his own like Connery in Dr. No, Moore in Live and Let Die, Dalton in The Living Daylights, and Craig in Casino Royale. You could see what each actor was trying to go far in their debuts, but Brosnan's Bond always felt confused. He was always an amalgamation of the previous actors, but his films kept changing. GE is a Dalton script with Connery/Moore humor, TND is a nineties take on Moore's TSWLM and MR, TWINE is a bit stripped down and feels like an early Connery film, and DAD is the 2000s MR.

Today she brought up the topic of gender equality and was going on and on about how unfair it was that even at this day and age women were still treated as the \"lesser\" gender and that everybody should respect and practice gender equality. She then asked each of us if we agreed with her.\n\nThe other 3 coworkers just went \"yea I guess\" while i shrugged. She turned to me and asked me if I disagreed with her.\n\nI told her that I didn't really believe in gender equality as males and females are biologically different by nature (stated it as a fact) and there will naturally be different expectations of people in certain aspects. And that sometimes those different expectations can manifest in discrimination, which I wholeheartedly disagree with. That does not change the fact that we ARE biologically different and \"gender equality\" just...doesn't work if taken to the logical extreme.\n\nShe got super offended and started accusing me of being a sexist (technically accurate), misogynistic (for the record, I never expressed any opinions on the topic before this) AH. \n\nI pointed out that in our culture, it was standard practice to give 3 months of paid maternity leaves to mothers who just gave birth, while dads only got a week of paid paternity leave. If we were to apply GE in such a scenario, we would expect the mom to be back at work after just a week of post childbirth. She went off on how the mother had to carry the baby for 9 months and would need to breastfeed the kid for some time. I told her I totally agreed with her, and that was a perfect example of why GE doesn't work: males and females are BIOLOGICALLY different and we couldn't just \"treat everyone equally all the time\".\n\nShe continued to accuse me of sexist thinking and it was people like me that caused women to be discriminated against. At this point, I had had enough of her insults and asked her \"doesn't your BF pay for your portion whenever you guys go on dates? And didn't you once say that you judge potential dates on whether they offer to pay for you on the first date?\"\n\nShe said that was different and that its common practice / gentlemanly behavior for a guy to offer to pay for the girl on a date. I said \"I don't disagree (I actually don't, I pay for the girl on dates all the time), but that goes against the very idea of GE. You can start trumpeting on about GE again once you actually split your bills and pay him back your portion for all previous dates, otherwise you're nothing but a hypocrite who only wants equality when it benefits you.\"\n\nShe refused to speak to me for the rest of the day, so I wonder, AITA for what I said?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Although these appliances have been challenging with the day to day needs of having twin two-year olds, they're beautiful!\n\nOne question regarding the GE fridge - and I admit this is a basic one. I seem to have to defrost the freezer every 2 weeks or so. The method I've used is to take everything out, carefully use a heat gun and gently scrape with a plastic putty knife. If anyone has a tip on a better way to defrost this freezer, it would save me about an hour every other week!  Thanks in advance for the help and picture of the patient is attached (even though I'm embarrassed of how much frost is on there right now).", "Shiny GE with the Diego shiny looks good ngl"], "2021-04-28": ["Alright, I'm gonna list out a few things I would reccomend having before speedrunning said classes. Also, I would like to mention that because I  have only played the game for exactly 1 Month, and 1.5 Weeks, I have not progressed every class.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRequirements:  Transportation - Any class that isn't slow works, the best would probably be shinobi because of grapple. (really helps with going to yaalda with no climb) \n\nSilver - Silver can be easily farm with either of these 2 methods: Having an Ultra Blacksmith Alt or Server Hopping Crypt and Isle of Eth and the ravine at Sea of Dust. (Make sure to abuse mytril glitches )Server hopping nets about 80 silver per ore hop and 50-3000 per crypt hop. (3000 if you get lucky and find an artifact such as a pheonix down or ice essence).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrips/Rots - If you are a chaotic class, having a dinakeri can drastically cut the time getting grips, otherwise, just get a scroom alt and spam from orderly spawn. If you are going an orderly class, if u have access to teleporting to sky, do the quests there for extra silver and orderly but for the most part, just pay for jail service or get 2 scroom alts to get your silver and rots in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExp - This one is a very specific way  to speedrun and requires already having a necro, but just spam bounds in the dagger room at oresfall and keep the shreikers on docile. Knock the shriekers, respawn, rinse and repeat. The other way to speed run is to either just wait till ur day 1, mana punch for one round of z-scrooms and get your weapon exp for the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now that I'm done with the requirements here are the tips for each class! :\n\nDeep Knight - Deep Knight isn't necessarily the hardest, it is only difficult to find another CK to grip so just buy a CK Grip or if you have a Kasperan alt, make it a one skill church knight (Cost is about 650-700), get your grip and sell the rest for 1k. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbysswalker - The key to this one is not buying the regular greastsword, just get scroll of viribus and create a blockade for howler while doing both quests. Als when doing the torch quest (at least for me) there is 2 things that can happen. If you are doing the tortch quest and your tortch is not lit, you can cheese the distance you would have to go by just not moving and getting gated to giant's staircase then lighting your tortch with a nearby torch in Renova Town. Another tip is to record as you get the \"Come to me my child.\" Propt before jumping in, and here is why: [https://streamable.com/vpwgsx](https://streamable.com/vpwgsx) &lt; -- Abyss didn't glitch.  [https://streamable.com/qah30u](https://streamable.com/qah30u) &lt;-- Abyss glitched. Also, to be able to freely go in and out of the abyss, you only need 15 grips and to have done both quests. You only need the 60 grips for the skills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDark Sigil Knight - Learn Deep Sunken. That's literally it. ( And do the dsk paper quest to actually go into the hall of mirrors.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragon Sage - Don't wear sigil helmet, get max climb, meditate, dragon speech and that's about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSigil Knight Commander - Nothing really here, just get your orderly from rots and you should be able to afford it. (Get Solan's asap, without it you are essentially a Sigil Knight with extra steps.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhisperer - Just get your silver and get the Wraith. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOni - Make sure ALL and I mean ALL of your prerequisuites are done, if they aren't don't even think about talking to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, for anyone that is interested in what I have progressed over my 1 Month and 1.5 Weeks playing Rogue Lineage:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbyssdancer(2x): Once as a 1 skill Kasperan and the second time and a Max Uber Godstruck\n\nDeep Knight (7x): My first time getting deep knight was on my 1st Dinakeri Alt and I got Deep Knight 7 times on it.\n\nAbysswalker (5x): Abysswalker was my first gaiadwelling build (Made an Elder Vamp Kasperan) the other 4 were from Kasperan 3 other times and Dinakeri once.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChuch Knight (23x): My first week playing I got Church Knight on my first race ever, Gaian. I would literally wipe everyday when I progressed Church Knight because of my house members either goofing around or purposely killing me. (was very toxic, and my first week of playing I progressed CK 8 times in one week due to said house members and exploiters constantly gripping me and me not knowing about the rogue lineage discord till my second week of playing. (PS, got banned literally 1 week after being in the rogue discord and my main roblox account got permabanned. Reason: Mod claimed at first that I trying to scam for restores because I dm'd multiple mods, then when I proved that I wasn't he claimed I was banned because me at the time, someone who only knew how to progress CK and was doing so as a gaian somehow found a way to mess with restore logs?

But enough ranting about my unfair dilemma.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWraith Knight (3x): Ngl Probabaly the easiest progression I have done for a chaotic class since I was a dinakeri. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOni (1x): Ngl, this was the hardest since I had no clue about how to fight the lava snake so I wiped like 5 times to that alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdicts Progressed: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeer (Tier 1 as of now) : Ngl, I did that shit by complete accident, I did all the quests in gaia cuz I didn't feel like doing rots for d sage, then realized i could ge that ez seer and just did what I needed to in khei and wiped, And now I got a seer edict madrasian. :)  Also almost got seer on my Godstruck Dinakeri but didn't do liquid wisdom or the Guilnir Delivery quest.  \n   \n Welp, now that that's done with, if you liked my cringe in-depth take on my rogue lineage progression, be sure to upvote me and be on the lookout for more ig. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if anyone can, help me get my main unbanned, I've only play rogue for 1 week on it, ( my first ever week plaaying rogue lineage btw )  and I rerolled from gaian to morvid the day it got banned. :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlmost forgot to add this for proof of my first max uber: [https://streamable.com/a5x4gn](https://streamable.com/a5x4gn)", "Let me explain.

Overwatch has been down for 5-6 months which mean they wont get banned and all cheaters will end up in the higher ranks.\n\nMedals are more important then trust as trust doesnt work, spinners has green trust. Ofc as there is less people in the higher ranks you're bound to play against them once in a while. I deranked my account from Supreme to MG1 within a day for that reason. More enjoyable if you dont want to play faceit as cheaters are mostly in higher ranks.\n\nIf you're wondering why overwatch isnt working we simply don't truly know. Many are guessing someone are overwatch botting a lot of accounts and saying NO for all sections which have been shown to be effective before. This results in no one getting banned.\n\nWelcome to CS in higher ranks. If you hit DMG-LEM you find more people that are trying to hide it.

If your school has limited offerings try a summer online class at a big CC like this one and then anything your school doesn\u2019t have maybe you could do online from there to reduce the number of transcripts you need. Also check other CCs in the same district as yours - they usually have at least one sister school.", "Caught \ud83c\udfa3 you \ud83d\udc49\ud83e\udd1e in 8K UHD surround \ud83d\ude2a sound \ud83d\udc42 16 \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udee3 Gigs \u2795 ram \ud83d\udc0f, HDR GEFORCE \ud83d\udcb2\ud83e\udd57\ud83e\udd22 RTX, TI-80 texas \ud83e\udd20 insturments, Triple \ud83d\udd963\ufe0f\u20e3\ud83e\udd49 A duracell battery \ud83d\udd0b ultrapower100 Cargador Compatible \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc4c iPhone \ud83d\udcf1 1A 5 \ud83c\udf84 W \ud83c\udd7f\ud83c\udd70 1400 + Cable \ud83d\udcfa 100 \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05% 1 \ud83c\udf84 Metro \ud83d\udd25 Blanco Compatible \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\ude0a iPhone \ud83d\udcf1 5 \ud83d\udd33 5 \ud83c\udf84 C \ud83d\udc80 5S 6 \ud83d\udd55 SE \ud83c\udd71 6S 7 \u2757 8 \ud83d\udc4a X \u274c\u2763 XR XS \u274c XS \u274c MAX \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude08 GoPro \ud83d\udcf9 hero \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc6 1 \u2757 2 \ud83d\udd5d terrabyte xbox \u274c series \ud83c\udfac x \u274c Dell UltraSharp 49 Curved \ud83d\ude16\ud83e\udd22 Monitor \ud83d\udc40 - U4919DW Sony \ud83d\udc9d HDC-3300R 2/3 \ud83d\udc54\ud83d\udee3\" CCD HD Super \ud83e\uddb8 Motion \ud83d\udce6 Color \ud83c\udfa8 Camera \ud83d\udcf7, 1080p Resolution \ud83d\udd2b Toshiba EM131A5C-SS Microwave \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffd Oven \ud83c\udf73 with Smart \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc4d\u2764 Sensor \ud83d\udcb0, Easy \u2705 Clean \ud83d\udec1\ud83d\udc4d Interior \ud83c\udfe0, ECO Mode \ud83d\ude08 and Sound \ud83d\udc42\ud83c\udffb On/Off, 1.2 \ud83c\udf46 Cu \ud83d\udc4b. ft \ud83d\udeac, Stainless Steel \ud83d\udd29 HP \u2764 LaserJet Pro \ud83c\udd71 M404n Monochrome Laser \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udc84 Printer \ud83d\udda8 with Built-in Ethernet (W1A52A) GE \ud83c\udd71 Voluson E10 Ultrasound Machine \ud83e\udd16\u2699\u26d3 LG \ud83d\ude4f 23 \ud83d\udcca Cu \ud83e\udd11\ud83d\udca6.

Just wanted to clarify some things for you. \n\n1. You don't need an AA-T to transfer (I didn't bother doing one). Focus on completing IGETC and your major requirements (which can be found on Assist).\n\n2. Berkeley requires everyone to finish IGETC and they will instantly reject you if it isn't completed so focus on finishing that up. Also, the more major requirements you do, the better. Finishing up all of your major requirements makes it really likely that you'll get into the UC you want to go to.", "Trying to fit my major requirements into my schedule was getting difficult because of my AA-T, it\u2019s doable but my AA-T is my last priority at the moment. I\u2019m definitely going to prioritize my IGETC! My major requirements are all going to be taken during three different semesters but I will have them all finished before my last spring semester.
