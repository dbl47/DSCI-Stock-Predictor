Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.\n\n**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. \n\n**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.\n\n**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)\n\n**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.\n\n**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.\n\nThis is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:\n\n[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)\n\n**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity. There will be peaks and valleys, but I think there's a lot of room to grow, especially once the vaccine is widespread."], "2021-01-04": ["Hallo,\n\nwegwerfaccount wegen Privatsph\u00e4re.\n\nIch bin mitte 20, wohne in Luxemburg, habe also den Vorteil zum steuerfreien Kapitalgewinn wenn ich l\u00e4nger als 6 Monate halte.\n\nIch habe durch Krypto an einen hohen Gewinn erzielt und m\u00f6chte ein sicheres Standbein haben (also sicherer als Crypto) .

Otherwise, we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road. So, while we do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the batteries to make cars that that we've already got already on our plate.\n\nThis is why the Semi is maybe coming in 2021 instead of 2019 like it was supposed to. \n\nIt should be pretty obvious that making big batteries is limited by number of batteries but from this article,\n\n[https://electrek.co/2020/08/14/tesla-increasing-powerwall-production-elon-musk-delivery-delays-2021/](https://electrek.co/2020/08/14/tesla-increasing-powerwall-production-elon-musk-delivery-delays-2021/)\n\nLong delays, prices just got increased, production is trying to ramp. I'm going to say they're supply constrained. For what is just a big battery in a shell, it's probably batteries being the limiting factor.\n\nSo every kWh Tesla deploys in storage is one kWh in cars on the road and losing them automotive revenue; every kWh in car is one less kWh deployed in storage and losing them energy revenue. It's zero-sum and direct competition in terms of battery supply. From the earlier calculation energy storage is taking around 7% of Tesla's total batteries. \n\nThe point was that Tesla energy is still growing, only the increased production is mostly going into cars. At $520/kWh for a Powerwall with cells costing $100/kWh it's kinda ridiculous. You can buy an entire Model 3 LR for $46.5k, that has 75 kWh for $620/kWh. Once battery is no longer a bottleneck and isn't competing with their automotive segment their energy segment revenue will explode.\n\nSay their car production rate stays fixed and battery production doubles. Tesla puts all spare battery capacity going into storage, then we would see 2 \\* 11,635 MWh total battery production with 10,875 MWh going into cars, and 12,395 MWh going into storage (+1,600% from current)."], "2021-01-13": ["", "Yes this is correct: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/short-interest)", "Sorry, your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kwdsup/tsla/) in /r/stocks has been automatically removed due to Rule 3:  Low effort.\n\nIf you just want to post 1 liners or just want to know everyone's thoughts, then post a comment to our daily discsusion thread which are generally stickied or [click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+daily+discussion&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/), and **especially** [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) **which aggregates the most news for almost every stock**.\n\nIf instead you're wondering what a term means, go to Investopedia.com and search for said term there.\n\nEither way come back here to repost with your findings, thanks!\n\nA list of the [rules can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/rules/), and if you're new to r/stocks please see the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and/or [read this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4x1419/if_youre_new_here_read_this_post_first/)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That kept me away from investing youtube videos.\n\nWhen the COVID lockdowns started, I had a lot more freetime to myself.

I don't remember which video it was, but I do remember that the video said that innovation accelerates during times of crisis. The person recommended people buy TSLA due to a huge short squeeze about to happen and then bitcoin to counter the government printing massive amount of money.\n\nI was working from home, and since I didn't have anything to spend money on, I took my entire disposable income and put them into TSLA and bitcoin.

Hundreds of thousands of retail investors are buying the $GME 60C ($60 $GME call options) across the options calendar and Market Makers can't hedge properly, because there are not enough $GME shares to buy. (Basically, there are were more short positions than shares available)\n\n1a. What is a **Market Maker**? A market maker is an individual or brokerage firm that buys and sells securities for its own account, at prices it displays in an exchange's trading system, with the primary goal of profiting on the **bid-ask spread**. The most common type of market maker is a brokerage house that provides purchase and sale solutions for investors in an effort to keep financial markets liquid.\n\n2. As stock prices increase, the shorts are forced to cover their shares borrowed, by the Market Makers (who they've borrowed them from). But because of the huge supply/demand imbalance, these shorts have to cover at prices that seem irrational, but are rational based on the supply/demand equilibrium of available shares. What's going on, is probably an infinity squeeze, which is the result of heavy over-shorting of shares, which are now difficult or impossible to cover. (Basically, **There are too few $GME shares available, and shorts will be forced to buy back $GME at any price).** This triggers a mass panic for the exits by anyone who are short shares.\n\n2a. What is a **Short Squeeze**? A short squeeze is when a stock\u2019s price jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to prevent an even greater losses. Them buying up the stock, adds to the upward pressure on the stock's price. (Basically, a short squeeze accelerates a stock's price rise as short-sellers bail out, to cut their losses. Short sellers are being squeezed out of their positions, usually at a loss.)\n\nIn financial history, the two widely cited cases of an infinite short squeeze are the Volkswagen infinite squeeze of 2008 and the Blue Apron one of 2020.\n\na. Prior to October 2008, Porsche controlled 30% of VWs shares. The government fund of Lower Saxony (home province of VW in Germany) owned an additional 20% of VW as a strategic stake. In addition, various index funds owned around 5% of VW (These index funds were required to hold VW in proportion to its 17% weight in the DAX, such that they would not be able to sell simply due to changes in the price of VW).\n\nb. So, you can do the math, 55% of VW shares were already unavailable in the market. As a result, when Porsche increased its stake by an additional 44%, it meant that the true available float went down from 45% of outstanding shares to around just 1% of outstanding shares. Suddenly the seemingly \u201clow\u201d short interest of 12.8% turned in to a massive supply and demand imbalance. Millions of shares needed to be bought immediately even though there were simply no shares available to be sold.\n\nPS- Sometimes stocks *which appear to be the \u201cbest short ideas\u201d can also be the ones which often end up being most likely to see the most violent short squeezes*\n\nPSS- Perhaps a $TSLA infinity squeeze is in place, but will be slower than the $GME squeeze IMO, and also with a more permanent price increase."], "2021-01-27": ["Hey Everyone,\n\nI've been watching this subreddit do things unimaginable, and I think its amazing.

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***At Close of Monday***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* Specialty Chemicals\tDD\tDuPont de Nemours Inc\t73.14\n* GME\tGameStop Corp.\t225\n\n*Maybe*:\n\n* Alternative Carriers\tLUMN\tCenturylink Inc\t11.77\n* Apparel, Accessories &amp; Luxury Goods\tPVH\tPVH Corp\t82.45\n* IT Consulting &amp; Other Services\tDXC\tDXC Technology Co\t25.5\n* GGP\tGreatland Gold plc\t23.7\n* MAC\tMacerich Co\t14.01\n* GAS\tState Gas Ltd\t0.58\n* COV\tCovalon Technologies Ltd\t1.3\n* ARG\tArgos Resources Ltd\t3.25\n* QS\tQuantumscape Corp\t42.33\n* KNDI\tKandi Technologies Group Inc\t8.51\n* PLTR\tPalantir Technologies Inc\t33.96\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 2:** Company | Current Price | Average Price\n\nCall:\n\n* ~~Sync error will check on it again later.~~\n* Las Vegas Sands Corp.\tLVS\t49.07\t55.32\n* U.S. Bancorp\tUSB\t42.75\t47.49\n* Dollar General Corp.\tDG\t192.75\t211.00\n* Verizon Communications Inc.\tVZ\t54.28\t57.54\n* Verizon Communications Inc.\tVZ\t54.28\t57.54\n* Progressive Corp\tPGR\t86.19\t94.40\n* Everest Re Group Ltd\tRE\t211.50\t233.11\n* Tractor Supply Company\tTSCO\t139.72\t153.41\n* Nucor Corporation\tNUE\t49.02\t55.40\n* Greatland Gold plc\tGGP\t27.00\t32.37\n* Quantumscape Corp\tQS\t42.33\t56.05\n* Air Transport Services Group Inc.\tATSG\t25.95\t28.16\n\nPotential Call:\n\n* ~~Sync error will check on it again later.~~\n* Tried to add as much as I could.

This effect can be as much as 80% of the total options outstanding in my experience, but is usually less. This caused a lot of the GameStop action we saw before known as a gamma squeeze.  It is possible to create the reverse, and that's a hobby of Steve \"Stevie\" Cohen (to sell a giant straddle and lock the price down). If a stock seems to be de-volatilized after I said it had a lot of gamma, there's some chance this happened. \n\nDelta de-hedging is also a thing. When options expire, speculators (read: you) tend to sell the itm options for profit, and tend not to roll them fully, which causes reversion against the options. In other words, if there are a lot of ITM puts expiring, the stock will tend to go up, while if there are a lot of ITM calls expiring, the stock will tend to go down. This tends to matter the most on the monthly and quarterly and yearly option expirations. This Friday appears to not be one of those.\n\nBecause this data is stale, you can't draw firm conclusions, and you'd want the update tomorrow if you have access to these tools (spotgamma and tradingvolatility, or you can add by hand). However, it's important to understand the magnitude of these gamma hedging effects by dealers. These are always relative to the floating shares of the stock. For reference:\n\nAMC: 114m shares (Maybe, they just had a bunch of new issuances and debt conversion, could be higher)\n\nCRSR: 88.1m shares\n\nSNDL:435m shares\n\nAPHA:312m shares\n\nTLRY: 137m shares\n\nGME: 70m shares\n\nIn my experience, if a price move will involve 20% or more of the shares in open interest (options contracts x 100), it will tend to cause gamma squeeze effects in a lot of speculation. Numbers under this will still impact. It starts being not very noticeable at 5% or less for a price range (such as a 20% spread). Typically the price ranges you would look to would be plausible price ranges.\n\nToday, a lot of weed stocks ran all the way up their gamma ramps and stalled, which means new gamma ramps need to be constructed, and I would expect it to be harder to move these weed stocks up more tomorrow except for SNDL (more on that below) For this reason, you will need to look CLOSELY at the new options printed for end of week and on as of tomorrow AM (or Thursday) when option data comes out. Right now, these stocks will look like all downside - gamma ramp below current position, since those stocks ripped through their gamma ramps completely today.\n\n**Brief analysis:**\n\nGME: I honestly have no idea. The stock is for sure gamma dominated right now, and getting past this expiry will reduce volatility a lot as things roll off the book. Interesting, there are a LOT of puts and most of the purchases of options appear to be puts right now.\n\n**TLRY**: This just ripped through a gamma ramp, forcing buy of a remaining 5 or so million shares on the float of 137, which is a small effect. Most of the buying today was thus new capital coming in, which is quite remarkable. Looking at the OI tomorrow for expiry friday will be very important in understanding what is going on, but, **THIS STOCK WAS FUELED BY PURE NEW BUYING AND NEW CALL OPTION PURCHASE.** I guess there's no substitute for being \"The\" weed stock. Just remember that every dollar up requires the same amount of new capital as the last dollar - 50% days get a lot harder when already up 50% the day before. New gamma ramps will be created, but these get harder as IV has already risen a lot. Thus, would expect the momentum to continue, but this will quickly go into a bubble state like GME did. Be cautious!\n\n**APHA**: This also just fully ripped through gamma ramp, and in fact did on Tuesday. At this point, it's all dependent on new open interest creation and money. Gamma ramp wasn't actually that big though, and the forced selling friday is small. This appears to mostly just be straight buying. \n\n**SNDL**: I don't have data on spotgamma, so I had to rely on just tradingvolatility.com. My read is that this stock has an outrageous amount of gamma, on the order of the float of the stock, and you can expect more vol. This leads me to suspect that the float data isn\u2019t accurate (outstanding shares are 1.5b while float is stated to be 436m). There are some moderate ITM call expirations Friday, on the order of 15-20m shares on a float of 435m shares, so I don\u2019t expect a huge impact.  But, this stock appears to be pretty spring-loaded with options and could go nuts again.  Examining data tomorrow will be important.\n\n**CRSR**: This isn\u2019t actually that gamma dominated at a float of 88m. It\u2019s right in the middle of a big gamma ramp, so buying will send it up fast \u2013 and selling will send it down fast. Friday expirations are not that significant. This stock will behave semi-normally as a result. \n\n**AMC**: I\u2019m not sure what the float is here, but the actual option OI suggests AMC is in the middle of a gamma ramp, and that gamma ramp is immensely strong relative to float \u2013 this stock is expected to continue a lot of volatility unless these options are a bunch of covered calls or covered puts. My suspicion from price action is that they are not, and this will keep being very volatile. This ramp will lose strength in the 8s, so it will require a much heavier lift to get past there. Friday expirations are immaterial. Selling also can send it down, much like CRSR. \n\n*My positions: I own none of these!

So to limit the upside for Tesla by institutions that want to slow tesla down, keeping a lid on the share price makes sense. If right, this goes away next week.\n\n* Reduce options volatility. Imagine some big players wants to get a large amount of long dated calls. It makes sense to suppress the share price temporarily to reduce options premium. I would keep an eye on long dated calls today and next week. Don't know how to do this though.\n\n* a paper hand shakedown.

So to get more shared, create a bear sentiment to loosen some shares. If right, look for large closing cross transactions in the coming weeks.\n\nI realize these are all bullish scenarios.

I do not recommend any position here. Everything here is speculation and my personal opinion and not to be construed as factual in any way. I may not be correct on some of my numbers. Do your own research before making a play.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional disclaimer: I am not in any way suggesting that people sell at a certain price en masse. We are all individual investors and choose to hold or sell based on our own tolerances and decision making. This is merely discussing selling *strategy,* not a call to action. For that reason, I will not be sharing my specific sell prices although I will be sharing what got me there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the past two days, I've been developing an exit strategy that works very well for me. Keep in mind that I have over 100 shares, so the things I am considering might not apply to someone who is holding less. Still, there are a few areas of strategy that I want to share and hopefully can stimulate some good discussion. Here are a few key points that I thought of for myself, feel free to discuss and disagree with if you wish:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) **Determine a price point to begin your selling.** Whatever reason you have to select a price point is up to you, but for many of us this is life-changing money and we should all be asking ourselves the question *what do we want to get out of this?* You may have to revisit this point at times as you consider your risk/reward tolerance and how bad you need the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) **Set aside a certain percentage of your holdings to DCA some profit.** For some it might make sense to hold to 10k but for many of us, locking in profits incrementally would be financially beneficial and frees up some money to buy dips in other securities, exercise options,  or to simply withdraw if you need the cash. I know it is fun to say \"10k isn't a meme\" but we have to be realistic about our financial goals with this trade and plan accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) **Consider exercising options with your profits/cash.** If you have been paying attention to my positions I added in my previous posts, you'll know that I am playing some FD monster spreads and some high(ish)-value naked calls. The reason I invested in those naked calls is so I would have the ability to exercise them if the situation makes sense for me. To me, having flexibility is important and I want to be in a position to react at whatever the market throws at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, side note- I have been doing research on how long it takes for exercised options to hit your account, and I couldn't find any information on it. Can somebody please educate me in the comments?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) **How do we determine the increments in which we sell?** I've considered three ways to do this:\n\na- Percentage increments\n\nb- Dollar increments\n\nc- Sell increments by the day\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me, percentage increments is more attractive and I feel gives me a nice ladder of profit that I am comfortable earning from my position. Think about what might be right for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) **Most importantly, HAVE A PLAN!** Whether your plan is to hold until $69,420 or sell it all Tuesday at open, make a plan and STICK TO IT! Everyone has different financial situations and motivations in this trade. No matter the context, you must have a plan and *stick to it!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) **No matter when or where you trade, have a plan for your freshly minted tendies.** Reinvest or pull out? SPY puts or buying the TSLA dip? Buying GME calls? Whatever the case may be, have a plan of action for your money. For many of us, this is more money than we have ever had to manage. I will personally be taking out a large chunk to make other investments, and keeping a chunk in to continue to play the market as the chaos ensues. Either way, the theme of this post remains the same: **have a plan.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7) **Don't be an emotional trader.** As price moons, dopamine will moon as well and we need to learn how to manage ourselves in those moments. Having a plan and sticking to it is a great way to do that. I will personally be setting aside a portion of my position to sell at my emotional discretion, but I am not doing that with more than I am comfortable with losing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are all the main things I thought of, and things that are important for me to consider with my style of investing.

Their current trajectory is to start mining spodumene contrctrate by the middle of this year and become the worlds cheapest, per tonne, producer of lithium hydroxide. The company is in it's final stages of obtaining all the necessary permits for mining and chemical processing out of NC and the basic idea is that because they will be able to mine and produce the end product within a close proximity they will be able to outperform other South American miners (that produce lithium from brine which needs to be shipped to China to get the final product).

As the current biggest controller of end product lithium is China (as most of the worlds mined lithium needs to be sent there for processing).\n\nA reliance on China in the long run is not great due to obvious reasons, and also the costs associated of shipping the stuff often makes even the cheapest lithium mines very expensive.\n\n**Financials**\n\nAs I mentioned, PLL is still in it's final exploration stage and obtaining permits for it's operations.\n\nOver the last quarter Dec-20 their cash burn from operating and investing activities was $4.1M (or $8.6M 6 months to date).\n\nThe also recently raised additional equity during the period which left their total Cash and equivalents at $70M at the end of the period.\n\nLooking a bit further into their annual report for 2020, they made a loss of $6.1M for 2020, down from -$10.1M in 2019 (due to the exploratory nature).\n\nOn the balance sheet their Net assets sat at $24M (pre-equity raising) with little to no liabilities.\n\nOverall a strong balance sheet and P&amp;L that can sustain the current rate of cash burn for sometime in the negative event of mining delays and other hiccups.\n\nI recommend taking a dive into the financials yourself.\n\n**Global lithium demand/supply**\n\nSo outside of the fact that PLL is positioning iteself to be a scalable, low cost, local producer of lithium hydroxide the elephant in the room is, does the world need more lithium?\n\nAnd is demand and supply moving in such a way that pricing works in the our favour?\n\nThe cost of lithium has steadily declined over the past years partly due to the economies of scale that producers achieve as they ramp up production but also cost efficiencies achieved from advances in extraction and processing techniques.\n\nI believe we are at at a turning point, or at least a price stablisation equilibrium as the demand for lithium increases due to the expanding domestic and commercial use for it.

The same award that was given to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, SpaceX founder Elon Musk, and Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nToday WolfPack Research released on 02/16/21, note this is important as the Chinese New Year Holiday runs from Feburary 11th - Feburary 17th and its a legal holiday week.\n\n[EHANG: A STOCK PROMOTION DESTINED TO CRASH AND BURN](https://wolfpack-whitepaper.s3.amazonaws.com/EH.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUPWWN73KG77R5OP4&amp;Signature=%2FT3%2FIZPg9Dy%2BlZhyzQjdFo8Huow%3D&amp;x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEoaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQD2W97FtzCPNyQ4M7ubfDMWk4CZCN%2Fums06S5xKcaBubgIhAIenmbsZZEuWIag%2BekPHkJI7HYbq%2BXlrWkWdr2WPKOxuKs0BCFIQARoMMzA4NjEzNjExMjIwIgxxgZqM0Lo1NrVfgC0qqgGcxGHCGA%2B1z781XEaYJvBUmdSPL9DeFYVfbKOuFhZbilRffysWHOcsnG6al8eGNXxRcEGWCfWexoRGRIuMI0pmQ%2BVwbQ2PF8S%2BNLQLk2%2F1d1i01nqnmOTb5Ihs5i7336n9LLvslDzhaLTpAAm0D4FJb6jHOqhQt4rhQF2s6TXM4t91wNBLrZzRJUTcqhfcbXrDxlg33p2biikrEltJhpgszvEpLmf5JXwhIDCV27GBBjrfAWUlRTf0DswFo7O%2F3vINRAJ8izCaMVGKf6xaCplp6dokdgYFegOCQiC5r8b3UOOIbfSx9ZOKbWeEIOKy2pASs%2BlkBQHzjUt8WOAo4C%2BZWXmkzgscaiBP%2F2g%2Fe4ndYtpg3bzFUL0NcGaGIX0hioYgp5JY59n6PKTmXrfTG9%2Fsc82Lm4ESDXBFruPESIJ0eHXSgVC99joTMsiCATCJnRwzWR2GHgTafOqGH96f%2B20YA70nr%2FB7%2F1IT78QtYRAQIuMeYQ4UhvKrAgt735VASf2Xuayb%2F1l72sHf7tTQaa3mGSw%3D&amp;Expires=1613529036)\n\nOf the portions of the research that are suspicious, or have clearly a bias, or have questionable content as they cannot be confirmed or verified in the report and should be ignored in the report.\n\n1. Suspicious Timing  \n\n   1. As the Chinese New Year is in full swing, it is a week long federal holiday. This ensure that panic sellers will not be able to reach with out any additional information.\n   2. Slow releases starting around 1200EST-1400EST or roughly 2300-0300 in China, which also ensures that any response will be delayed until after panic selling has been complete.\n   3. This in fact caused the stock price to drop almost 62% which brings to price back to roughly \\~1 month ago before its run up.\n2. Lack of Personnel in EHang Locations, Video Released by Wolfpack Research:  \n\n   1. No metadata on Youtube video, unable to verify date and time stamp. Claimed to be shot during January *but no exact dates are provided.*\n   2. Video taken over the federal holiday, there of course would be no people in the building.\n   3. But what we are able to see is that there are actual EH216 vehicles that are being built and/or assembled, with lots of parts in boxes. If there were actual fraud, there would be absolutely no reason to even spent the effort in having all those parts and pieces. In fact there would be ample security to ensure that no one would ever discover the deception.\n3. eVTOL expert Dr. Moore from Uber and NASA  \n\n   1. Regarding his opinion of the use of hobby motors and general quality. Working at NASA we have seen how stagnant NASA has become due to their over redundancy and unwillingness to take risk compared to how SpaceX operates. But redundancy is waste, especially in startups that do not have the federal money. If \"hobby\" motors work, then why over-engineer something? I think we can draw parallels to early Tesla motors but the key thing is that they worked and that is all that matters.\n   2. Lack of research budget, when you work for NASA anything that is not in the billions would of course be considered anemic, but the company is working first to pioneer passenger VTOLs and then moving on getting acceptance for autonomous technology.\n4. Flight Autonomy Dream (Headline: It is not, its already here and it works)  \n\n   1. Flight autonomy is already well used in the the aviation industry. In fact the majority of your domestic and international flights utilize autopilot where the pilot has pre-entered in a specific heading and altitude.\n   2. DJI with their Mavic Air series are able to perform limited autonomous flight in a consumer drone for under $1000 including takeoff, object detection and avoidance, GPS flight routine, landing, and return to base landing. If a consumer drone maker can do this it is not a leap of imagination to think that the same principles can be applied here.\n   3. ***There is nothing special regarding autonomous flight.***\n   4. In fact you can see from this Wikipedia image regarding autonomous control levels shows that as early as in 2000s with the Predator and Global Hawk autonomous flight was already widely used in the defense sector. Today the focus into the future are fully autonomous swarms, far far ahead of what is necessary for autonomous drone flight.\n\nAutonomous Control Level Trend\n\n1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Office Visit - Distributor of EHang  \n\n   1. Interview with employee who \"claimed\" to be the finance manager pushing to sell their own drones, which does not make sense because Kunxiang does not make any drones and is a distributor. Also the finance manager reportedly said that their drone had *4 hours flight time* which is an absolutely unbelievable claim versus EHang's 30 minutes of total flight time which is far more realistic. No additional evidence was provided by WolfPack regarding the \"claimed\" finance manager, name, title or any of substance.\n\nOf the portions that provide a negative attack and are at best circumstantial evidence\n\n1. \\# of NewsWire PR Articles - Apparently having 55 news article in 14 months constitutes a pump and dump scheme.\n2. Lack of Infrastructure Progress and Investments - Because not all progress has gone according to plan, I wonder what other large companies have had the same issues that have become one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n3. Misleading English/Chinese Press Release  \n\n   1. While the titles maybe misleading, Googling the original Chinese press releases identifies does not actually mislead any of the readers. It does not make any false claims regarding passenger vehicles or their permitting, in fact it is actually Dr. Mark Moore who is making the *assumptions based upon the title*. And you know what they say about assumptions, they make an a\\*\\* out of you and me. I would think that a NASA engineer would take his time reading the article, I mean they certainly are taking their time with SLS.\n\nOf the portions that have merit:\n\n1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Price Disparity  \n\n   1. Of all the points in the short research, this maybe one of merit.\n   2. The buyer purchased EH216 at widely varying prices from 1.5 million RMB per unit to 150 million RMB as stated in two difference SEC Sales Contract reports. This wide disparity is a note for cause.\n2. Rapidly Growing Accounts with low account receivable and allegation of fabricated sales  \n\n   1. Is this not similar to how TSLA presold cars? Additional research needs to be done into this.\n   2. Again the research does not say it is evidence of fabricated sales but only that is a textbook indication. ***Again circumstantial evidence is not real evidence.***\n   3. ***Why is this buried at the tail end of the report? At page 19 out of 33.*** If this was truly damning than it should have been at the forefront.\n3. Ongoing Lawsuit  \n\n   1. Could be a future issue, however without knowing the full evidence of the trial it is difficult to make judgement.\n\nWolfPack Research History so far (two words, desperate &amp; terrible)\n\n[https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports](https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports)\n\nOf the 6 short researches, all of them insisted that the various companies committed fraud and yet ***5 out of the 6 stocks*** are up since their report. I will not mention the tickers as they have all been banned by the mods. With a singular exception, they say a broken clock is wrong twice a day. If ever there was a clear evidence of false reporting and market manipulation this is it. In my opinion WolfPack research utilizes its financial disclaimer purporting that this research is only an expression of their opinion to side step any legal ramifications.\n\nI have to state that $EH has been on a tear lately and as a very young startup it has been on a tremendous run up. It more than likely would have drop due to a pull back but I believe that air transportation will be the next TSLA, especially in China where the population density is 153 per KM2. Electric air transportation is the only way to alleviate the congestion that is plagues their streets and their cities.\n\nBut I like this stock!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclosure: Long on EH since 2020.

A fart in the desert wind. But perhaps the following prose can give you some perspective. \n\nFor what it's worth, (about a half bitten tendie from faggy D's), I have a very broad, vague, and practically non-credible view on the future of retail. \n\nApes Hang Together\n--\nSeeing how humans love to connect and be near each other, this will be a very basic principle that forms the cornerstone of the retail environment. \n\nLocations will be geared for entertainment, learning, and intense psychoactive sexual experiences. They will not be for shopping or any essentials, as necessary things will be done by automation (AITX) and drones (UAVS). I'm holding stock here and also automation in EV and clean energy (e.g. TSLA).\n\nI digress. This post is about GME, and the vision that I have been having. \n\nA Brief Story About GME Today\n--\nFirst a bit of background: I walked into a GameStop the other day for what was arguably my first time ever. The experience was nothing more than than an absolute dreadful shit pile. \n\nI was yearning, burning, for something to buy. Anything to buy to support this retarded box of worthless shit. I even went in with an 8 year old girl, and all we could manage to buy were two small keychain stuffed animals for like $2 bucks each. It was awful. \n\nNow, you may be thinking, wtf my GME boner is gone and I can't get it back. Well shove a finger up your ass boys because this is where it gets good. \n\nOne word. \n\nUpside. \n\nWhy Shitty Is Good Up Until Now\n--\nIf a GameStop had an amazing experience, and it was absolutley mind and dick blowing, then that would be very bad. But because it has extreme potential from where it's currently situated, it has also enormous potential to \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 to the \ud83c\udf19\ud83c\udf19\ud83c\udf19.\n\nThe Vision of GME's Future\n--\nWhen I close my little eyes reaaaalllll tight. Here's what I see:\n\n40 seconds after I swipe up with my dick on a spankin' new, hyped up FD, I get a notification on my phone telling me that my ride arrives in exactly 69 seconds. In the future, Fidelity offers you a cleaner dick swiping interface than Robinhood ever did...**plus** asshole-print and mushroom-stamp recognition technology. The days of frantically finger fucking your fone to find your 'folio are gone forever. \n\nMy ride pulls up. I toss my martian cigarette in the trash and I hop in. There's grooving techno-elevator music bumping. 7 seconds later I arrive at GameStop. \n\nThe Tesla comes to a silent halt. The doors open. The vehicle lands. I have arrived.\n\n\"Boom, tsss. Boom, tsss.\" I can hear the deep bass funktron music. Chest pounding commences. \n\nI rip open the musuo black door with a glowy backlight trim and damn near almost run into a hot barmaid cosplaying as Sectonn, the milf predecessor of Metroid. She offers me a shot of espresso without question. I'm a paying GameStop member, as indicated by the avatar that lights up above my head. \n\nOff in the distance is some weird spinny dude with VR goggles and wires connected to various points on his body. He's in some contraption that allows him infinite movement in any/all directions without actually moving outside of his 3-ft radius. \n\nSuddenly lights flash and my attention is grabbed by the DJ booth. They're giving away a PS69 and some kick ass gear. The music intensifies. Some dude swallows a flaming sword for some reason. No one told him to.\n\nThat's all I see. The vision doesn't go any further. But it's enough to convince me. \n\nMy ape friends keep asking me, \"When do I finally sell? What's the exit strategy? What happens if it dips?\"\n\nMy brothers in apehood, I will tell you exactly what I tell them: \"I am not a financial advisor. I hold positions in GME and AMC.\"\n\nThen I reassure them not to think of today, tomorrow, or next year. Don't think about what the stock is doing, how badly the regulatory agencies will likely neglect the retail trader, or the extent to which the big boys get off the hook (for now).\n\nThese things will not last. We know this. It's as sure as prophecy itself. The meek shall inherit the earth. And that meek is a small, little known collection of retards, apes, gamblers, and bank robbers.\n\nSo when you're thinking about selling GME, ask yourself what better entity is there to patronize for time immemorial?\n\nFolks this isn't about money. It's about lending your liquidity for the fight. \n\nYou take the money out when the company no longer needs us. Or when you need the money to keep yourself in business. \n\nThe money you gave to the cause is likely lost forever. So when you think about selling, think about 20, 50, or even 100 years down the road. When every GameStop is just a collection of humans in egg shaped, fluid filled receptacles with tubes on our dicks and down our throats...when the GME hivemind finally manages to immerse each one of us into a permanent state of bliss and ejaculations. \n\nThat's when you sell.\n\nBy then the stock will be worth $42,069.69 (pre-split, of course).\n\nSo until then, I will just utter two final words:\n\nWe hold. \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a", "Sorry, your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmfyx5/should_i_keep_2_shares_tsla/) in /r/stocks has been automatically removed due to Rule 3:  Low effort.\n\nIf you just want to post 1 liners or just want to know everyone's thoughts, then post a comment to our daily discussion thread which are generally stickied or [click here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+daily+discussion&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), [Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/), and **especially** [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) **which aggregates the most news for almost every stock**.\n\nIf instead you're wondering what a term means, go to Investopedia.com and search for said term there.\n\nEither way come back here to repost with your findings, thanks!\n\nA list of the [rules can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/rules/), and if you're new to r/stocks please see the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and/or [read this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4x1419/if_youre_new_here_read_this_post_first/)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

For those who don't know (like many of you who are  new on this sub) inflation is the rise in the general price of goods. Some inflation is good for the economy and the fed target rate for inflation is 2%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's why inflation is increasing. Obviously last year the markets dipped temporarily due to COVID-19, but since the March dip the Federal Reserve and the US government have kept the money printer printing non-stop for over a year now.  There's a ton of new money in circulation. \n\nIf you look at the M2 money stock ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2)) you'll see that nearly \\*\\*50% of all US dollars made\\*\\* were made in 2020. The US has NEVER printed this much money in it's entire history.  We've seen over $3T printed in the last year ALONE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo why's this a problem?? Stimmy means I can gamble more money on the stock market right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've ever taken an introductory economics class you'll know that as there becomes more of something the value of that thing goes down. If I've $1 and then suddenly everyone get $2000 from a stimmy my $1 doesn't seem so valuable now does it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is exactly what's happening with the US dollar. If this continues at this rate it'll cost you like $50 for a slice of bread or something insane like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you might be saying \"obviously this isn't going to happen because we have the Fed to control our money supply\" and you'd be right BUT what happens when inflation goes up? The way the Fed decreases the money supply (historically) has been in higher interest rates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the 1980s when inflation was at a then all time high the Fed funds rate reached nearly 16% ([https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)). The current Fed rate has been at a historical low for the longest period EVER (since 2008).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so  high rates who cares?? \n\nThe higher the rates, the harder it is to borrow money meaning that business hire less people. This, in turn, leads to higher unemployment. In the 80s when inflation was 14% (as opposed to the target 2%) unemployment reached nearly 10.8% which was the highest since the Great Depression.  \n\nHigher rates also means monthly payments on adjustable mortgages skyrocket (cough cough 2008) \n\nOne very important thing was different between the stagflation we saw during the 80s and the stagflation we're about to see is that there wasn't a global pandemic during the 80s (except AIDs but that's different because it didn't shut down the global economy).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n There's no telling how bad this could get but we do know that we CAN NOT print our way out of this problem because that would only make it worse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Retail Retards**\n\nRetail investors have also been FLOODING the stock market and many have no idea what they're doing and are literally gambling their life savings on $TSLA FD's.

I\u2019ve never seen that before.  I\u2019ve owned AAPL for the last six years and I have never (and I mean NEVER) seen the stock drop $2-$3 consecutively for this long.  AAPL has been one of my safest and most consistent investments, so I\u2019m a little surprised.  Especially since they just posted over $100 billion in revenue last quarter.

But I was mostly a buy and hold type of value investor so didn't look too much at the options market.\n\nIn the last 2 months, I got interested in thetagang techniques and tried it out with part of my IRA, mostly with cash-secured puts (CSP) to open up wheels. Here's some of my initial lessons learned:\n\n* **Manage your buying power**.  It can be misleading how much liquidity you have, because much of your large cash balance will be tied up in cash-secured puts.  Every week, look over your positions and free up buying power for positions that don't have much time value left in them.\n* **Stock selection matters** more than high implied volatility (IV) or even IV rank.  I naturally gravitated to solid companies that I already knew, and in general, those worked out well.  For the 2 cases I went with high IV stocks (SQ, TSLA) those didn't turn out so well - had to eat some losses to get out.\n* **Dump stocks you don't want after assignment.** If you're assigned a stock that you really wanted, no problem, start the wheel and sell out of the money (OTM) call options.  However, if you're assigned a stock that you didn't see owning long-term (maybe you got attracted to the juicy IV), sell an in-the-money (ITM) call option at (0.7) delta.  Would you have sold a -0.7 delta ITM put option to open a new cash-secured put on that stock if you didn't already own it?  That's the equivalent of owning the stock and selling a 0.3 delta OTM call. \n* **Timing matters for CSP entry.**  Have some type of technical system for entry into the cash secured put (CSP) leg of your wheel.  It could be as simple as selling CSP on a red day, or when it's over the exponential moving average, or whatever technical system you favor.  It becomes harder to profit on the wheel if the underlyer reaches the strike in the first 2 days.\n* **Avoid low-priced stocks**.  If the stock is less than $20, you'll have a hard time managing your position because the strikes will be in $1 increments on the monthlies.  This is a problem because not only do you have a harder time with targeting delta levels, the bid-ask spread on the option is wider because the market can't arbitrage the difference between the bids and asks up and down the options chain.\n* **Track your position and performance**.  Set up a worksheet so you can always see where your buying power usage, percent of max profit, P&amp;L (realized and unrealized), underlyer relative to strike, and days to expiration at a minimum.  I'm running positions on about 15 stocks, and it would be impossible to stay organized if I didn't have this.  I use Excel on Onedrive which has the nice feature of integrated stock price feeds, and it's easy to learn.\n* **Be patient**.  I haven't optimized my theta generation relative to capital, so my raw theta per day is 0.13% of the portfolio value.  That may not seem like much, but multiplied by 250 trading days, that's 33% a year.  Now, I'll probably lose a decent chunk of that to managing losing positions (I've read 25-50% of that), but that would leave a theta gain of 16-25%, significantly more than my expectations of basic buy-and-hold.\n\nI screwed up a lot in my first 2 months but got lucky and ended up with a P&amp;L that was positive by 2% over 2 months, with the first month not having much capital deployed because I was getting set up and having a few beginner screwups.\n\nI hope this helps other semi-newbies, and I'm always open feedback from those with more experience.", "There are lot\u2019s of EV companies rolling out via spac, it\u2019s ev bubble imo.

I deployed twice early in my career (age 17 and 19) and 100% of my income from those overseas deployments was tax free. As I was still living with my father at the time, I didn't know what to do with that money, so I just set it aside for later. \n\nA (Part Two): Between February of 2016 and April of 2017, My mother, father, grandfathers (both sides) and grandmother (mother's side) all died. It was a very difficult time, but it left me with a massive number of assets in the form of cash from life insurance, land and real estate, and other various items that I had absolutely no use for. I was the only child and grandchild so literally everything was left to me.\n\nA (Part Three): After part two happened, I threw myself into my work as a healthcare provider, working an unhealthy amount and averaging 74 hours a week in 2017 and early 2018. Money wasn't really an object in my mind, so it just kinda piled up even further.\n\n**I would not consider myself rich or even particularly wealthy, but I am acutely aware that I am in a much better situation that a lot of people, and that a lot of what I have presently was handed to me. I would enthusiastically trade what I was given as \"compensation\" for the deaths of my family to have them back.**\n\nI also wholly understand that the majority of individuals visiting r/dividends do not have $700,000 laying around to just throw into the market as they please.\n\nFeel free to double check my math as I am not particularly good at it. If you have any questions whatsoever, feel free to ask away and I will do my best to answer all of them as soon as I am able. \"Current Value\" numbers were calculated at various times throughout the day, and may not be perfectly accurate.\n\nThis post is flared as \"personal goal\", so I will write my goal here: **I intend for this portfolio to break the one million dollar mark by the end of 2021.**\n\nI hope this provides some insight into who I am, so as to create transparency and make myself more than just a shield that says **MOD- Constantly Learning**. \n\nAll the best.\n\n\\-Bdm", "I can't tell if people are staying up late or waking up early.

I believe support and resistances are better visible this way. It should help beginners see these levels at first sight. \n\n**Part I - Bull cases:**\n\n**SPY**\n\nPeaked through resistance and held. Common thought was resistance at 394.xx ATH while I drew my resistance line at 392.50 earlier last week. It held above 392.50 Thursday, resistance became support and whaddaya know a sharp bounce at 392.50 Friday intraday, turning green. Opened a new position on that support confirmation. 3/19 400c. If you're interested in learning charts, I recommend taking an actual look at the chart below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aim6y6vuzwm61.jpg?width=1548&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f63851b772f2bbf8cc7fd3a5cccd38d4d6f9c95f\n\n**Bull Scenario A:**\n\nSPY opens red and tests 392.50-393 Monday again, holds and closes above 396. If this plays out, we\u2019re likely see the 400 breach Tuesday intraday. I won\u2019t be spooked by the Monday dip. Might actually add. \n\n**Bull Scenario B:**\n\nNo repetitive back test. Face ripping rally above 400. \n\nWho would think folks will get their stimmy this weekend and the forbidden digital asset will trade above $60K? Honestly guys, this was kinda obvious. Not saying retail is single-handedly causing this. In my opinion, institutions anticipating this move is behind the $60K breach. I bet if we look at today\u2019s buying blocks next week, we will see double digit unit purchases dominating fraction buys. This will be the confirmation of institution involvement, bringing retail inside.\n\nAnyway,\n\n$60K+, VIX potential $20 break down, QQQ short term bottom(?) and current market momentum pointing SPY 400 Monday. Many more detailed indicators (Bullish MACD cross overs, call/put ratios, percentage of tickers above 200 moving average inside SPY etc.) supporting this but explaining them without a video is not practical. \n\nContinuing on scenario B...Test 402 Monday intraday, rejection, test 404 (actual resistance) Tuesday and a sharp rejection. This is where I\u2019m hoping to exit my 400c position and go short term \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. Monday closing above 400 (or not) will be the deciding factor. \n\n**VIX**\n\nFellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I\u2019d like to point out that last time it was under 20 was **more than a year ago.** Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, **Bull Scenario B** will apply 100%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e7kms0qy2xm61.jpg?width=1550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743d02ae122887214dbfcf976d2ffbb2a7f4aa0b\n\n**QQQ**\n\nI think we\u2019ve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing \ud83d\ude43 \n\nWhile QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it\u2019s going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above **Bull Scenario A or B** likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope.\n\n**TSLA**\n\nWhile 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. \n\nIn above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection.\n\nIn above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720.

Indicators look good although I\u2019m still iffy on the MACD, but it is curling up. If it holds the $14 support, then $18 is the next target (61.8% fib level acting as resistance for current price). Could also be a good play since earnings is Wednesday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$DNN:**  Daily chart setup looked great, but 4hr had a bearish reversal candlestick before it stopped trading this past Friday. I would like to see it hold $1.12 to $1.13 if it does reverse before getting in, but if it holds, I see it filling to $1.24 &gt; 1.33 &gt; 1.45.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$AQB:** Looks good as far as daily chart indicators go, but stochastics is nearing the 80 line so even if it runs a bit, it could pull back onto support at $7.46. That would be the best time to get in if that support level holds and indicators show that it\u2019s still a good play. If that holds, targets are $7.90 &gt; 8.25 &gt; 8.60 &gt; 8.84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*$UBER:** Stochastics over 80 line, MACD already curled up and heading upward, and RSI is now in uptrend on the daily chart. However, the 4hr chart is holding above a prior resistance level as support ($60.13). If that holds, we should see $61.30 &gt; 63.00 &gt; 64\n\n**$UBER Options Idea:** $60-70 strikes, 16 April 2021 exp date look like a decent play. Lots of volume and OI\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*$AM:** Daily indicators look iffy, but 4hr chart looks a lot better. Either way, price action is above an uptrend support level. If that holds, we should fill up towards $9.70 because it\u2019s trading within a rising wedge pattern (bullish). Then we can look for continuation if it breaks up and out.\n\n**$AM Options Idea:** $10 strike, 16 Apr 2021 exp, current ask is $0.30, lots of volume and OI as well. This is a safe play imo because it\u2019s not far from strike price, the underlying moves pretty decently as long as we give ourselves time, and we have a month from exp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$PLTR:** Returning from our watchlist last week...Still looks great for a swing play going off volume and indicators (excluding stochastics) on the daily chart. Try to get in as close to $26 as possible as that\u2019s support IF the $27 price level doesn\u2019t hold. If that $27 holds, that\u2019s our support, and then I\u2019d shoot for $28-29 as our targets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  \n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  \n\n\n**Tickers We\u2019re Still Watching From Last Week**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$BA:** Put alert out last Thurs to ride the continuation of the resistance breakout on the Daily chart. Sold to secure profit Friday morning, but BA kept going up throughout the afternoon and into AH. Could still play continuation to our first target before we sold out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$NFLX:** Put alert out after seeing unusual options volume, analyzing chart, and seeing great setup. Ran over 100% the same day I alerted it, but held because of no day trades. Still up 30% on calls. Will look to add if it gains more movement or secure profit if it starts to show weakness and look for reentry.  \n\n\n**$TSLA:** Ate a hard loss after NASDAQ took a beating last Friday. Still holding calls and will look to avg down and scalp it at the open or swing it longer. Will see how price action goes.  \n\n\n**$AMD:** Put alert out after seeing same setup as NFLX, currently up 14% on these so, again, will add on strength or sell on weakness and look for reentry.\n\n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  \n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nDisclaimer: This information is for educational and entertainment purposes only.

The past week we have seen strategic gap openings to utilize the gamma ramp. 16 is our next prize.\n\n8. At a certain point the short interest will be untenable and margins will get called.\n\n12. One may Profit.\n\n**If any of that has changed the thesis must be updated and expectations adjusted.**\n\n# The numbers.\n\nOrtex - Remember the Numbers are T - 1 Trading Day\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Power Table of Stat Madness|3/15|3/16|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ortex Screen Shot|[Link](https://u.teknik.io/H9JPX.png)|[Link](https://u.teknik.io/1lQL2.png)|\n|Estimated Short Interest|8.7M|9.8(+1.1M)|\n|Days to Cover|1.23|1.33(+.11)|\n|/u/pennyether did this|Total # Shares Delta Hedged 3/15||\n|15.5|7,271,921||\n|16|8,260,323||\n|16.5|9,222,653||\n|17|10,149,655||\n|17.5|11,036,401||\n|18|11,881,152||\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# This is not a done deal.\n\nAs we saw Friday a large player on the short side initiate a gamma attack by purchasing a metric fuck ton of Puts which altered the buy/sell orders coming from MM to maintain their delta neutral stance to move to the sell side.  Essentially temporarily cut off from their supply lines of support, Longs struck a retreat, pulled the backstops and ran with the price down to what it opened at.  While the prices of options cratered, someone bought a fuckton of hyper cheap 15$ calls and closed them out.  This is either\n\n* A - A market maker looking for a good deal on hedging some short positions\n* B - A Ronin slipping in to scalp the fruits of war.\n* C - The short interest essentially turning states witness and hedging their outstanding short interest at a price 90 cents higher than the current share price.\n\nThe SP stabilized **at the opening price**.  The effect of this in my option would be like catching the sword blade while it is being swung at you bare handed, snapping it off and throwing it their face.\n\nLongs effectively told shorts, \" You're not in control, you just think you are. You just spent 500k or more on that and we are still going to close green. Bitch\"\n\n\"I'll see you at the bike racks on Monday after stimmie check Christmas.\"\n\nWe are now in an active fight.  Expect it to get messy.  This isn't just spend money and win. 8 million shares at a sp of 17 is **136 million dollars** they stand to lose at the very least. People have been murdered for way less.  Don't expect them to go down without a fight.  You wouldn't just walk away either.\n\nListen, the 16 is a magic number. I am not going to tell you what to do but after friday, that portion of the gamma ramp is done.  If we are not over 16 sooner rather than later, I feel differently about my 3/19 options than I did last week.\n\nThat isn't to say that I am highly fucking bullish about this play.  The amount of gambling tier call options being purchased at open will be astounding and I think in the end we will be victorious.\n\n# Lets Fucking Go\n\n# \n\nEdit 1 - This will be the post for the week unless something dramatic happens I'll update the ortex daily.\n\nEdit 2 - Keep in mind what you would do to keep from losing 200 million dollars that you did have and what you would do to win 200 million that you didn't are two different things. I am coming to believe that our Long friend(s) have a deep, if not cultural understanding at how to win at Tai Chi Push Hands...\n\nEdit 3 - Earnings Monday March 29 AM\n\n# Previous WSB Editions\n\n1.

(At the time, VW traded at 19 times earnings\u2014\u201d \n* \u201cOn October 26, 2008, Porsche announced that it had bought enough stock and options to control 74% of Volkswagen\u2019s shares. twice that of its competitors.)\u201d \n* \u201cAnother firm, Northern Saxony, held 20% of the company... It wasn\u2019t selling. Passive index funds owned another 6%, and they couldn\u2019t sell shares either.\u201d \n* **\u201cCombined, they accounted for 100% of VW shares...** So as soon as Porsche exercised its options, there would be no shares left for short sellers to buy to cover their positions.\u201d\n\nTSLA squeeze in 2019 \u2013 2020 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* \u201cMany of Tesla\u2019s short sellers have closed out their positions over the course of 2020, with **short interest falling to less than 6% of the float from nearly 20%** a year ago, according to S3 data.\u201d \n* **\u201cWith shares up over 730%, Tesla bears have seen more than $38 billion in mark-to- market losses this year**, according to data from S3 Partners. By comparison, the next- biggest loss for short sellers was on Apple Inc., at just under $7 billion, S3 data shows.\u201d\n\n# Why didn\u2019t Gamestop squeeze in Jan. 2021? \n\n* Gamestop reached an intraday high of $483 on January 28th The options activity was extremely aggressive this week as far OTM options needed to be hedged by market makers, retail FOMO, and media hype fueled mass-buying as the stock continued to multiply in price. \n* Then, major retail brokerages including Robinhood halted and restricted the **buying** of GME shares, artificially decreasing buy volume. The stock plummeted below $100 in a few days and below $40 over the following weeks. \n* One particular hedge fund, Melvin Capital, had run out of liquidity during the price surge of Jan 28 and was likely on the verge of being margin called until.... \n* \u201c**GameStop short-seller \\[Melvin Capital\\] down 30% this year gets $2.8 billion bailout from the firms of billionaire investors Steve Cohen and Ken Griffin \\[at Citadel\\].\u201d** \n* Why would Citadel inject funds into a struggling hedge fund? Likely because the margin calling of this fund would have added jet fuel to GME rocket and collapsed all other shorts with it as they are forced to exit their short positions one by one. The shorts *must* work together or the entire house of cards will fall, leaving behind the biggest bag of financial shit of all time on the DTCC\u2019s desk. \n* Abusive shorting, the restriction of buying, and aggressive negative MSM campaigns drove a narrative that Gamestop was simply a pump-and-dump meme stock of little value and that the short squeeze was over. \n\n# But wasn\u2019t that the squeeze? Short interest dropped off too! \n\n\n\n* Market makers and players on the short side of this bet have ways of **hiding the true short interest of stocks.** To summarize the main methods they use: \n* Market makers buy deep-ITM call options to reset their FTDs (failures to deliver, aka shares owed to the institutions lending shares to short that are due to be returned at recurring deadlines, see the link for more FTD stats). [https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)\n* Exchange-traded funds holding Gamestop have been aggressively shorted. ETFs are meant to be passively held funds, and iborrowdesk has shown consistent shorting of **ALL ETFs holding GME.** \n* Shady brokers have been diverting retail buying through dark pools in order to suppress buying pressure on the stock to keep the price artificially low. They then dump sell orders on the open market to drop the price. \n* \u201cDark pools are exchange forums that replicate open stock exchanges, closed off to the public designed to hide institutional trading intent. In other words, by Gary Gensler himself, dark pools are designed to lack regulation, transparency and the light of transparency must be shone upon them\u201d - u/umu68 \n* Bloomberg terminals indicate &gt;140% institutional ownership of GME. This is impossible without naked short-selling, essentially selling a synthetic share that isn\u2019t supposed to exist, creating new shares in the process. Gamestop is supposed to have 70 million shares outstanding issued by the company itself. Many signs point that the number of synthetic shares far exceed the total of outstanding shares.   \n \n* DD for Deep ITM calls: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m05jed/mystery\\_solved\\_the\\_deep\\_itm\\_calls\\_are\\_coming\\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m05jed/mystery_solved_the_deep_itm_calls_are_coming_from/)\n* DD for Dark Pools: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/movevb/dance\\_of\\_darkness\\_the\\_sec\\_and\\_dark\\_pools/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/movevb/dance_of_darkness_the_sec_and_dark_pools/)\n* DD for ETF shorting: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls830a/found\\_the\\_reason\\_for\\_the\\_dip\\_they\\_are\\_shorting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls830a/found_the_reason_for_the_dip_they_are_shorting/)\n* Bloomberg terminal of institutional ownership: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme\\_institutions\\_hold\\_177\\_of\\_float/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/)\n\n# Damn, that\u2019s a lot of shady shit. Why can\u2019t they just do that indefinitely...aggressively short to always keep the price down? \n\nHedge funds have been abusive shorting over the decades, and they HAVE been getting away with it indefinitely, and Gamestop was their bankruptcy jackpot. But now, there are some key differences: \n\n**Retail investors own the float. Institutional and insider ownership have been squeezing them for much longer than January of 2021, starting as early as last year\u2019s annual meeting with share recalls. RC\u2019s 9 mil stake purchase in 2020 put even more pressure on shorts.**   \n \n\n* Insiders &amp; Institutions own &gt; 100% of the outstanding shares, even evidenced on the Gamestop website itself. \n   * [https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership](https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership)  \n \n* DISCLAIMER: This post is highly speculative in nature.

Across other major US retail-oriented brokerages, similar rates of retail ownership could be estimated with high user counts. The average number of shares per user can be speculated to be 5/user, 10/user, 20/user, and beyond in order to estimate the SI%. It is purely speculative though, but for example, if 10 million Americans own GME and the average shareholder has 20 shares, that is 200 million shares, or nearly 3x the outstanding shares, NOT including institutions or insiders. \n* Users on Fidelity are placing &gt;75% ratio of buying to selling orders. This signals extremely bullish retail sentiment. (Important: these ratios do not indicate the quantity of buy/sell orders, but this ratio has remained consistently very high).\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lajjs2/almost\\_75\\_of\\_all\\_retail\\_gme\\_orders\\_were\\_to\\_buy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lajjs2/almost_75_of_all_retail_gme_orders_were_to_buy/)\n   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/msyhlq/fidelity\\_users\\_purchased\\_about\\_61\\_million\\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/msyhlq/fidelity_users_purchased_about_61_million_more/)\n\n# Remember the VW squeeze info? \n\n* VW squeezed to become the most valuable company for one day on only 13% short interest. This was largely achievable because about 100% of the float was being held by companies and institutions long on VW, drying up the market liquidity, making it extremely difficult for shorts to cover and pumping the stock to infinity and beyond. \n* We\u2019re in a similar situation with Gamestop at institutional ownership of greater than 100%, short interest verifiably exceeding 140%, not including retail ownership, ETFs shorting, or other maneuvers market makers/hedge funds have used to hide their positions. \n* So the float is overwhelmingly held by passive funds and insiders who are **RESTRICTED** as to when they can trade shares... Sounds like a nightmare liquidity situation for shorts who could owe hundreds of millions of naked shares. Even with absolutely massive retail panic selling, the amount of GME float choked by institutions and insiders alone could drive an extremely powerful squeeze far greater than the VW squeeze, with SI% being at unfathomable, systemically questionable levels that compromise the stability of US markets as a whole. \n* The thing is, retail investors like the stock. They REALLY like the stock. They don\u2019t want to sell either. \n* **So the short interest is likely greater than 300-500% (based on institutional ownership knowns, retail ownership estimates, missing FTDs, ITM options hiding of SI%) and nobody is selling. What could possibly go wrong?** \n\n# Now that we know our rocket is primed let\u2019s outline the potential catalysts for liftoff \n\n* As mentioned before, now that Gamestop has paid off its junk bonds, it can now issue a **dividend.** And likely a crypto dividend. This is really, *really* bullish news and gone over in greater depth in dividend section.\n* The DTCC (Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation) is a $60 trillion dollar company that settles almost every security transaction in the United States. \"DTCC is a holding company of DTC, FICC and NSCC...**DTCC common shareholders include approximately 362 banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds and other companies in the financial services industry participating in one or more of DTCC\u2019s clearing agency subsidiaries, including NSCC.\u201d** \u2013 US treasury gov website. \n* Why does the DTCC matter? **The DTCC has passed several regulations in the recent couple of months that when acted upon at any time, could trigger a squeeze.** And unlike the SEC, the DTCC has incentive to enforce these rules because when Citadel and other hedge funds implode from their reckless activity, the DTCC will be left holding the bag. They want to reduce the weight of it if possible. \n* **Share recall for the annual meeting.** This particular catalyst is imminent, as the deadline to recall looms closer. For shareholders to vote in the annual meeting, they must recall their shares from the players who are borrowing them to short sell. \n* Any positive news: \u201cRC is the new CEO!\u201d \u201cDFV just went all in!\u201d \u201cGamestop announces new crypto coin dividend!\u201d \n\n# Crypto Dividend \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsbhojusvut61.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9051487f46875c8b372559d28ba902d2595a901\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mqbu5a/gme\\_possible\\_overstock\\_20\\_overstock\\_issued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mqbu5a/gme_possible_overstock_20_overstock_issued/)\n* How does a share dividend work? Shareholders get paid the dividend, whether its $1 per share $5 per share. **But shorts do not receive a dividend, in fact they have to PAY the dividend per share**. And since shorts have sold potentially hundreds of millions of shares, they\u2019ll have to pay dividends on all of those holdings. \n* Overstock was being abusively shorted and the CEO issued a crypto dividend. The stock hovered in the $3 range in March of 2020, only to squeeze to $128 later that year after issuing a crypto dividend. \n* In the words of u/Stupiddum: \"Overstock didnt just issue *any* dividend the issued a fucking **CryptoDividend** By doing this they FORCED a share cover... In a normal dividend they can just credit the amount to the account boom\\* bam\\* done.. with a cryptodividend they reside in the blockchain.. and the only way to receive said dividend is to have that physical share. \"\n* Crypto Dividend signals company strength, acknowledges the shorts, increases the stock price, and forces shorts to cover unlike a cash dividend. The coin would increase sales and company growth, increasing the brand value of Gamestop as a \u2018tech stock.\u2019 Any shares that are not being held by the lender will have to be returned in order to cash out on the dividend. Many if not most of GME\u2019s shares are being lent out and will have to be repurchased in order for the stock owners to receive their dividend. \n\n# DTCC Rules for Dummies \n\n* All credit goes to u/Antioch_Orontes read this DD if you want an ELIAPE explanation for all of the recent DTC, NSCC, and OTC filings.\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/msh5mt/a\\_brief\\_overview\\_of\\_recent\\_filings\\_from\\_the\\_dtc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/msh5mt/a_brief_overview_of_recent_filings_from_the_dtc/)\n* The amount of rules that pertain to the market loopholes we\u2019re witnessing hedge funds use to manipulate $GME shows that the DTCC is well-aware of the mess looming around the corner.

Summed with [the 13f/g filings](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.59.0), this gives a lower bound on the total number of shares currently in circulation as well as the short interest.  Therefore, figuring this out would be great to help convince skeptics and shut down shills/FUD.\n\nThe general approach I take in this document is to try to estimate the fraction of all shares held by retail from a few different sources.  From this we can then divide the known institutional holdings to get some estimate of how big retail is.\n\n# Retail market share according to FT\n\n[According to the Financial Times](https://archive.is/drLS7), retail market share has been growing significantly in the last 2 years and is now the second largest source of all trading volume after high-frequency trading (HFT).  Based on their chart, I got the following numbers\n\n| | Market Share % |\n|--:|:---|\n| HFT | 45 |\n| Retail | 23 |\n| Quants | 13 |\n| Hedge funds | 8 |\n| Banks | 5 | \n| Mutual Funds | 6 |\n\n[Here's the same data in a pie chart:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSKfRL8EeXpZoCIe3ITFCsuHga-0AEAnPajpc6W8HqHMye7-INtn1MLDv5RShMr3HpIDCNAA34LeZ7I/pubchart?oid=1076768830&amp;format=interactive)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nkSdlG6\n\nBut the market share HFTs is misleading; while they have a large volume of trades they don't hold their positions very long.

Empirical evidence reveals that the average U.S. stock is held for 22 seconds.\n\nWhen we exclude HFTs, **retail is the biggest whale in the stock market**\n\n| | Market Share % (Excl HFT) |\n|--:|:--|\n| Retail | 41.8 |\n| Quants | 23.6 |\n| Hedge funds | 14.5 |\n| Banks | 9.1 |\n| Mutual Funds | 10.9 |\n\n[Again, in a pie chart:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSKfRL8EeXpZoCIe3ITFCsuHga-0AEAnPajpc6W8HqHMye7-INtn1MLDv5RShMr3HpIDCNAA34LeZ7I/pubchart?oid=1176366613&amp;format=interactive)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/2MujZuS\n\nThis suggests that a typical security has **40% retail ownership on average**.\n\n# Retail market share according to Fidelity\n\nSince I don't have a Bloomberg terminal, we can check the 40% estimate using Fidelity's ownership data.

We've seen lots of these hit WSB rapid fire since the rise of GME in some futile effort to break retail.  You know what they are: weed, silver, ...  All of them pumped to high hell by the Motley Shill and summarily dumped on the poor fools greedy and dumb enough to buy in:\n\n\n| Ticker  | Other % |\n|--------:|:--------|\n| [SNDL](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/fundamentals/ownership.jhtml?stockspage=ownership&amp;symbols=SNDL) | 99.9 |\n| [PSLV](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/fundamentals/ownership.jhtml?stockspage=ownership&amp;symbols=PSLV) | 89.7 |\n| [NOK](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/fundamentals/ownership.jhtml?stockspage=ownership&amp;symbols=SNDL) | 95.7 |\n\n*GUH!* those are some heavy bags.  SNDL doesn't even have a board any more!  At 99% retail ownership, it's just worthless paper with no insiders or institutions or connection to a real company.  Fuck the WSB mods, the Motley Shill and Robinhood for pushing this garbage on people.\n\n## AMC, KOSS and GME\n\nFinally there's the big 3.  I grouped all of these together because they are the same 3 securities [implicated in the Apex Cartel price fixing conspiracy](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mq4gfi/sec_filing_merger_with_brokarage_detailing/).  They've all traded more-or-less the same since January, though AMC has recently begun to break out of the pattern:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/q96E6Wr\n\nIsn't it strange that our beloved GME trades exactly the same dip-for-dip, peak-for-peak as [a company that makes mediocre headphones](https://www.koss.com/)?\n\n\n| Ticker  | Other % |\n|--------:|:--------|\n| [AMC](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/fundamentals/ownership.jhtml?stockspage=ownership&amp;symbols=AMC) | 79.2 |\n| [KOSS](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/fundamentals/ownership.jhtml?stockspage=ownership&amp;symbols=KOSS) | 68.3 |\n| [**GME**](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/fundamentals/ownership.jhtml?stockspage=ownership&amp;symbols=GME) | **0.1** |\n\nGiven the extreme interest, no surprise AMC is at 79% and KOSS around 68%.  **BUT WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WITH GME**?!  0.1% of GME is only 70000 shares.  **DFV ALONE HAS MORE THAN TWICE THAT MUCH**.  Clearly this number is totally wrong.\n\n# Estimate of the REAL retail ownership\n\nGiven the fraction of all shares owned by retail and the size of all institutional holdings we can compute the number of synthetic shares as a % of the total shares outstanding.  Here's a quick table I put together for reference:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wNMYBHf\n\nAccording to the [latest Bloomberg terminal drop](https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwdqyh/22042021_gme_bloomberg_terminal_information/), institutions have at least 110% of all shares outstanding. So:\n\n* If retail has 40% (like AAPL), then 83% of outstanding shares are short. **58.1 million shorts in total**\n* If retail has 50% (like TSLA), then 120% of outstanding shares are short. **140 million shorts in total**\n* If retail has 70% (like AMC), then 267% of outstanding shares are short. **186.9 million shorts in total**\n* ...and if retail has 80%, then *450% of outstanding shares are short*.  **315 million shorts will need to cover**\n\nConclusion: **Retail is leviathan**.  And shorts r fuk"], "2021-04-24": [], "2021-04-25": [""], "2021-04-26": [], "2021-04-27": [], "2021-04-28": [], "2021-04-29": ["My brain may be smooth, and I may be high, but why wouldn't we expect to see GME announce a split right now?\n\n*Market detached from reality\n*TSLA shouldn't have gone up after split, it did\n*GME shouldn't have gone up after 3.5M sell, it did\n*Market is not setup in retail's favor, they won't let it all crash over this\n*Shorts need to cover, they'll be able to without destroying the stock market\n*Share price will rebound quickly, and continue to grow as shorts cover to get out, corporate sentiment will be at an all-time high, and media attention will be crazy\n\nSo I have an idea to make it happen. But first, a question: does a group of retail investors with no other affiliation stand to risk similar penalties on bribery as another corporation would? What are the statues on those laws?\n\nMy idea is simple, (very obvious) inception. We get $500 from 200 investors on here or WSB and we use the money to buy a Tesla for whoever gets into the new CFO role. (Provided they don't already drive one, we'll need ground recon for that one though. Bullish.) \n\nOn delivery we leave a note telling them to look at what TSLA did and ask themselves why GME can't do the same on a smaller scale.\n\n\ud83d\udc12 \ud83d\udc12 \ud83d\udc12 \ud83d\udc12"], "2021-04-30": []}
