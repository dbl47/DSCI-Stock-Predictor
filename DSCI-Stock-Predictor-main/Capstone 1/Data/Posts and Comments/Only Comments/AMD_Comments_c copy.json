Intel makes a new socket almost every generation, and sometimes even the same generation will have multiple sockets meaning different motherboards. AMD 1000, 2000, 3000, and the upcoming 5000 CPUs will mostly all work on all AM4 motherboards, although some 5000 series CPUs won't work on some X370/B350/A320 boards and maybe some B450 boards, and B550 doesn't support CPUs before Ryzen 2000/3000 depending on the board, plus X570 and upcoming X670 doesn't officially support 1000 but in many cases will work anyway.\n\nYou also need to consider RAM. DDR4 is going to be on its way out after these next gen CPUs get released, they'll probably be the last generation to support it. If you have a really old computer with DDR3 you won't find support for any remotely modern CPUs and you'll need to buy new RAM in addition to a new motherboard.", "[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/8wtyb8)\n\n|Type|Item|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 3 3200G 3.6 GHz Quad-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/J8drxr/amd-ryzen-3-3200g-36-ghz-quad-core-processor-yd3200c5fhbox)|$99.99 @ Best Buy|\n|**Motherboard**|[MSI A320M-A PRO MAX Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/TWJmP6/msi-a320m-a-pro-max-micro-atx-am4-motherboard-a320m-a-pro-max)|$58.98 @ Newegg|\n|**Memory**|[G.Skill Aegis 8 GB (1 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/yz6qqs/gskill-aegis-8-gb-1-x-8-gb-ddr4-3200-memory-f4-3200c16s-8gis)|$29.99 @ Newegg|\n|**Storage**|[Silicon Power Ace A55 256 GB 2.5\" Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/kh9tt6/silicon-power-ace-a55-256-gb-25-solid-state-drive-sp256gbss3a55s25)|$27.99 @ Amazon|\n|**Case**|[Apex TX-606-U3 MicroATX Mid Tower Case w/300 W Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/NM9KHx/apex-case-tx606u3)|$49.99 @ Amazon|\n|**Monitor**|[Acer K202HQL 19.5\" 1600x900 60 Hz Monitor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/xTvRsY/acer-monitor-umiw3aa008)|$69.98 @ Amazon|\n|*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts*|||\n|**Total**|**$336.92**||\n|Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2020-10-01 01:08 EDT-0400|||\n\n* Stock cooler on either the 3000g or 3200g, the price of the 3000g is very high right now\n* 3200 RAM at 8gb\n* SSD drive\n* case w/ psu", "Oh right forgot about Bulldozer, but then again probably best left forgotten.

I tried to post the stuff MLID highlighted in red, which he felt was more confident info but some of it is what he posted in white text, or less certain. I didn't include everything but I hope this captures the majority of what's important.\n\nRDNA 2 - Some Background Info:\n\n* Navi 21 is the top die for now. There is not some secret 96 CU die.\n* N21 uses GDDR6. HBM samples were tested but currently even the top professional card being marketed behind closed doors uses GDDR6.\n* MLID won't rule out HBM but \"the fact is right now there is zero evidence one is coming to desktop\".\n* AMD is currently *considering* 18 Gbps GDDR6 for the top model but \"18 Gbps is not officially selected\". GDDR6X is too inefficient.\n* AMD sources have consistently mentioned VRAM &amp; efficiency increases over the previous gen as winning features over Ampere.\n* AMD is feeding AIBs a lot of incorrect info.\n   * There was recently thermal testing going on with AIBs, but most of this was done with dummy kids that don't even have a real die.\n   * Even internally at AMD most testing is done on cards with a BIOS that locks out true rendering capabilities. You may be able to see clockspeeds and power draw, but other it is locked down so no real benchmarks can run.\n   * MLID: \"It's likely that almost every RDNA 2 benchmark leak you have seen is fake\"\n* Many die configurations that were tested that will never see the light of day. One of the designs rejected a long time ago is a 384-bit bus, 80CU die.\n* AMD has also been putting out fake IDs, fake specs, and fake names in drivers and software for months.\n* Initial run of RDNA 1 had hardware level bugs. Those bugs contributed to the driver issues of late 2019.\n* MILD: \"AMD is holding back the release of RDNA 2 until they are absolutely sure they have stable drivers at launch, or at least they are attempting to do so.\"\n* MLID: \"Ray tracing should be better than Turing, and a new upscaling/sharpening algo similar to what consoles use is expected to combat DLSS. That's all I can say.\"\n\nNavi 21:\n\n* Prosumer \"Almost Quadro A6000\": 80CU @ 2.05 GHz - 2.2 GHz, 250W TDP, 256-bit mem bus, 32 GB\n* Top Gaming N21: \"AMD was not impressed with 3090 performance\", \"Sources connected to AMD are starting to sound more bullish than a month ago\". 72-80 CUs @ 2.15 - 2.3 GHz, 250-300W TDP, 256-bit, 16 GB\n* Cut-down Navi 21: 60-72 CU @ 2.15-2.3 GHz, 200-250W TDP, 16 GB RAM. Multiple 10 GB cards tested but may not be a SKU.\n* Something was done to massively enhance bandwidth utilization. Multiple sources have provided info point to a large pool of cache.\n\nNavi 22 (More Speculative):\n\n* Top Gaming N22 (Not 100% Confirmed): 40CU (?) @ 2.35-2.5 GHz (MLID is sure of the clockspeeds), 160W-200W (MLID is sure of the power consumption), possibly 192-bit + 12 GB RAM. \"Infinity Cache\" size unconfirmed.\n* Cut-down N22 Gaming: There is a 10GB 155W card on the professional roadmap.\n\nNavi 23 (Mostly Speculative):\n\n* There is an 8 GB card positioned below a 10GB card on the professional roadmap.\n* N21 is 256-bit for sure, and considering that N22 is probably 192-bit, that means N23 is probably 128-bit, which aligns with the RAM size.\n\nLaunch Info:\n\n* Pro N21: 32 GB, more VRAM and greater perf than A5000 but not expected to be better than A6000 in raw perf (but more efficient), validation in December (A6000 is getting validated now, for comparison), Q1 launch, $1999 - $2999\n* Top Gaming N21: 16 GB, will challenge 3080 but \"is unlikely to win at everything\". Note: Performance is still not finalized. MLID thinks it won't likely win outright in 4K but this is to be determined. Hard launch by Thanksgiving. MLID's estimated pricing: $549-$699.\n* Cut-down Gaming N21: 16GB/8GB (?), MLID thinks perf is above 3070 w/ hard launch by December and possibly launched at same time as Top Gaming N21. MLID's estimated pricing: $449-$599, possibly cheaper if there's an 8GB version.\n* Top Gaming N22: 12 GB, 2080 performance, likely Q1 launch but may launch sooner, MLID's estimated pricing: $379-$449.\n\nDirect quote from AMD higher-up:\n\n* \"No more jebaiting.

A 20-25% IPC gain NOW when they are equal to Intel, that will be huge news and way more difficult than Bulldozer to Zen", "In that case, then yes, I'd lean more towards a full upgrade. A 4770k is still a quad-core at heart. \n\nFor current products, a 6-core/12-thread 10400 or 10600k build can be of consideration. The current AMD CPUs would be the 6-core/12-thread 3600 or 8-core/16-thread 3700x.\n\nI do suggest to wait a week to see what AMD brings to the table with their new Zen3 CPUs, though.", "AMD had production yeild issues, that's why AMD laptops are hard to find in stock", "Well since launch is in like 3 weeks, here is my prediction based on past events, the 3000 series, the consoles, current rumors, and logic. Screenshot / take with a grain of salt if you want. I predicted the 3080 to be 50-60% faster than 2080 and I was right on spot, so here\u2019s mine: \n\n- Navi 21 top die will beat the 3090 by 10%. So \u201c6950 XT\u201d will basically be 10% faster than the RTX 3090 while consuming 300 watts and cost $999.\n\n- Navi 21 cut down, aka RX 6900 XT, will match the RTX 3080, but will have at least 16GB VRAM and cost $799. \n\n- Navi 21 further countdown, aka RX 6800 XT, will be between Titan RTX and 3080 performance, basically 3070 Ti performance with 16GB VRAM for $499-$599\n\n- Navi 22, aka RX 6700 XT, will be RTX 3070 / RTX 2080 Ti performance for $399-$499 and will have 16GB VRAM. This is the 56 CU gpu clocked at above 2 Ghz. \n\n- Navi 22 cut down, aka RX 6700, will have 12GB VRAM and cost $349-$399 with RTX 2080 S / RTX 3060 performance. \n\n- Navi 23, aka RX 6600 XT, will have 6/8GB VRAM and cost $249-$299 with RTX 2070 Super performance. \n\n- Navi 23 cut down, aka RX 6500 XT, will have 6/8GB VRAM and cost around $200 and will have RTX 2060 S performance.\n\nSo that is my own predictions and speculations. I actually came up with these before I even watched the video, so I was surprised to see some numbers match Tom\u2019s. Also I think we might see 32GB consumer cards. If not, then 24GB. There are already 16GB AMD cards for consumers, so why not 32GB. RTX 3090 has 24GB and doesn\u2019t even have Titan drivers. More importantly, we should remember that drivers matter and that a gpu sucks if it keeps crashing when gaming (cough cough RTX 3080 and RDNA1). Also for those who are skeptical of biggest Navi beating the RTX 3090, don\u2019t make your judgement from just looking at the 5700 XT, that\u2019s like trying to figure out the RTX 3090 performance by just looking at the RTX 2070. Different levels and different ballparks. Think of how fast a hypothetical \u201cBig RDNA1\u201d aka RX 5950 XT would look like, and then go from there. (Hint: 3070 performance.) \n\nAlso if AMD can match the 3080 at a lower TDP, with the 3090 only 10-15% faster, it would be on AMD for not going higher. They have the ball in their hands right now and they have done 350w cards before. If nvidia can go 350w, Amd can go 350w too. If they can make a halo product, it automatically means more sales. Source: (google \u201cthreadripper\u201d.) \n\nThat\u2019s all.", "**Executive summary:**\n\n* Performance of RDNA2 will not be bandwidth-hungry, GDDR6 is enough to fuel it. This could be due to a new cache pool.\n* Navi21 3080 competitor will have 16GB VRAM and likely be as fast as 3080 in most things, but potentially not all.

Since the last few years, AMD only competed up to the x80 non Ti class cards from NVIDIA, which is funny as how people say Navi 21 will match the 3080, even though it\u2019s 15% faster. Looks like AMD is hiding the fact that they can, and I believe they will, beat the 3090 by around 10%. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why some people think believe these \u201cleaks\u201d.

Giant leap from what I had.\n\nNow, hopefully AMD can bring a similar value to the GPU side of things (something that'll make the used Polaris cards no longer the go-to suggestion).

I'm now thinking you should actually set a CPU voltage offset of -0.075V, which would cut your max to 1.3V. My 1600AF does 3.8ghz all the time at 1.281V, so your 7nm 3600 can surely do just fine at 1.3. You could go much lower as well, but start by doing offset -0.075V.

This operation is used a lot in the training of a neural network, and this hardware lets Nvidia do this in a single clock cycle, while conventionally it would take several. In short, it means that Nvidia hardware is simply *better* at it, and unless AMD makes something comparable they will always lag behind in this. Pack-fp16 can only do so much, especially now with new data types (TF32 and BF16) that fix FP16 issues and are more appropriate for machine learning.\n\nNothing magical about Tensor Cores, they are just really good at this one operation and have a fancy name. It wouldn't be impossible for AMD to add a comparable feature to RDNA, but you gotta keep in mind that AMD is a much smaller company than Nvidia and has a much smaller RnD budget.\n\nThese tensor cores also come at a price, they take up a lot of transistors, only work on a few data types (Turing only did FP16, Ampere adds BF16 and TF32), and can't really be used for conventional compute tasks. They also don't really help with inference from a neural network, you know, actually using it after its trained.", "AMD are already badly behind in market share.

That said, Intel is getting desperate to stay relevant. Quick history, Intel had no real competition pre Zen CPUs. The Zen launch had Intel cutting prices by 50% and where still struggling to move chips at least in the DIY space (aka anyone building and posting to reddit). In the last 6 months or so I have seen a handful of Intel builds vs mabey 2 dozen a week of AMD builds, and the Intel ones are after something specific, the last 10% performance and are willing to eat the extra $100 price, ultra fast memory (AMD gets flakey above 4000MHz memory clock). And to top off the desperation, Intel just about launched an AMD CPU, referring to there own product once and 11th gen twice, while mentioning 4800U (the AMD chip) by name or as \"the competition\" something like 30 times. Also one of the slides in the presentation was highly suspect if not outright daming: the 11th gen system had about 8 minute uptime while the 4800U was almost an hour. Someone asked what pass the 4800U was on.\n\nIf nothing else, Newegg has an extended return policy starting in November, also it depends on what your looking for, but there can be some good or at least decent deals if you wait a bit. Also things may actually be in stock.\n\nI don't bother with tier lists, in the time its going to take me to hunt down who vetterd them and their qualifications, I can just look up all the relevant info myself and have another half dozen builds layed out. The only exception is the PSU, I have 3 or 4 good ones that I go back to. And outside of overclocking it sort of doesn't matter. That said, I do have a tier list of sorts for parts, but also what I'm looking for in each pick.\n\nLiquid cooling as in AIO or custom loop? AIO is fine to move, for custom, it depends on exact parts, but at most you may need to drain the loop first depending on how big the move is. I see there is already a 'don't liquid on your first build', well your not going to know how to do liquid until you do liquid, and its not exactly rocket science. Just match parts and leak test. The only issue is price, AIOs are 50%+ air coolers and custom loops are about 50% more than AIOs.\n\nThe not a tier list tier list for hardware picks:\n\nJust a quick note, I'm not a fan of the unicorn vomit (RGB) and it can gunk up the works. CPUs are really bad at running the RGB timings or something, and having even 3 or 4 different control software can cut 10% performance. Your actually better off getting a cheap rasPi and doing DIY RGB if your after that.\n\nIn general, avoids:\n\nNZXT. Overpriced hardware and cases with airflow issues. The only thing really going for them is the clean look, but that's easy to find elsewhere. \n\nIn general, the starting picks:\n\nCorsair. Good design for cases with fans/mesh/airflow, good PSUs, decent RAM. They may be slightly more than some other options, but if your looking for something that's alright, having it designed by someone who knows how to handle high end stuff helps.\n\nPer part:\n\nMB- Asus fist pick, mostly comes down to good experience with some high end stuff and on the Intel side, they do actually keep with the stock specs. Gigabyte is slightly ahead of MSI for second picks, mostly down to price, but its going to depend on everything from layout to number of rear USB ports.\n\nRAM: For the most part RAM is RAM. Gskill first, Corsair second, as both have high end options. After that set the specs I'm, looking for and sort price low to high. And take off anyone who is putting obnoxious heat spreaders on, trying to save budget on cheap RAM is not going to make up for having to go AIO to get memory clearance. The only avoid here is Oloy, more than a few issues with hitting spec and they don't seem to have anything much faster than 3200 anyway.\n\nCoolers: AIO, Corsair or custom loop (aka 'other'). Air, Noctua for performance&gt;noise, be quiet for noise&gt;performance. I know there are a few gems hiding in the coolers, Scythe I think is one of them, but limited reviews on them. Do stay away from the blasted 212, its not $30 better than the stock AMD cooler and considering Intel chips try to self immolate your going to need something much bigger anyway.\n\nStorage. HDD options are WD or Seagate. Depends on use case, but its mostly 64MB+ cache, sort by price per GB. SSDs, top picks are Sabrent and Samsung. Good speeds and good IOPS (how many different things it can access instead of just how fast it can access). After that your looking at 2/3 the speed and about half the IOPS, so only a minor dip. I try to squeeze in at least 3000 read, 1800 write, and 300-400k IOPS, but it depends a little on how much budget is available. Its not one of those things that seems like a big deal until it is.\n\nGPUs- EVGA has good warranties, MSI tried to save 2c by using only half thermal pads, 100% sure that's not coming back to bite them. Other than that Asus or Gigabyte are fine. Sort by more fans and lowest price. And do stay away from half/mini cards, they run hotter.\n\nPSU. Corsair, Seasonic, Fractal design (of all people, the platinum one specifically) have some good ones, EVGA is a bit hit or miss with the lower tier units. Basic assumption is its harder to screw up a higher efficiency unit. For capacity, check PCPP, double the CPU then add 20%. That gets you some upgrades (you don't need double, your not adding a 3090 to a $1000 system) and overhead for boost clocks. Also it keeps your idle power from crashing under 20% and keeps your normal load around 50%.\n\nCase- Usually $50, lower tends to skimp on things like room for cables and fans. Fractal has some decent cases, corsair has some as well.

Both had 2GB allocated and vanilla Minecraft on fairly low settings such as the ones she was using wouldn't have approached anywhere near 2GB. The reason it seems to be getting close (1.5GB in the second screenshot) is because Java basically memory leaks by design, and every couple of seconds the garbage collector comes back around and cleans up all of the unused RAM - which is why you can watch it climbing steadily to around 1.5GB, then suddenly drop down to several hundred MB before starting to climb again.\n\nIt's difficult to say whether the 3200G is more or less powerful than the 1400. The 3200G is based off of Zen+ with moderate architectural improvements over the 1400, and is clocked slightly higher, but lacks SMT - as a result, pure single threaded performance should be better but multithreaded might be slightly worse, and in this case streaming demands a lot in terms of multithreaded performance. From a pure CPU standpoint they should have been able to stream nearly equally.\n\nGPU-wise, the RX 580 should also be slightly better than her own 1050 ti, but both should have been more than enough for Minecraft.\n\nThe problem is that the manager's PC uses an RX 580 with no dedicated hardware video encoder such as the NVENC encoder on Nvidia GPUs, so nearly all of the load of video encoding into the streamable format (which is a massive amount of load) ends up on the CPU. Combine that with Minecraft and a Live2D avatar and her CPU is being absolutely *wrecked*. Her own PC has a 1050ti with an NVENC encoder, and even if she doesn't necessarily know what that means, OBS defaults to using the NVENC encoder when it's available. The dedicated hardware encoder takes *all* of the load of video encoding off of the CPU, leaving it free to handle just Minecraft and Live2D, which is why her own streams go much more smoothly.\n\nIf you're using an AMD GPU to stream, you really want at least an 8-core or more (a 2700X or something) to give video encoding enough CPU cores while leaving some open for games. Otherwise, Nvidia GPUs are way better just from the NVENC encoder.", "I would also like some advice, specifically the AMD stock, it's 81.80 right now...

Her GPU is fine unless she wants to play way more intensive games. Even going to a 1700x would fix a lot of her issues (depending on the RAM that is). If I was her, she should tell people what her other parts are. My assumption is if she is running Ryzen 5 1400 it is a earlier AMD mobo, so she should get a x570, get Ryzen 1700x (use this to hold her over til the new Ryzen CPUs come out which is quite soon). Get 32Gb of RAM and move the GPU and possibly the PSU over. When the new Radeon GPUs come out, figure out which GPU is better and she should be good.", "AMD GPUs can *do* hardware encoding, but it doesn't actually have a *hardware encoder*. From my understanding it simply uses OpenCL compute, which uses GPU resources and ends up allocating less to the game, affecting framerate.

It doesn't affect framerate whatsoever.", "Yes, and the article is quite long, detailing AMD's history before Lisa Su was CEO too", "I hope AMD gives everyone stock options.", "https://i.imgur.com/yNt7MBo.png\n\n(Long-ass tech rant ahead)\n\n&gt;Also, I don't know anything about AMD chips. But looking at one or two benchmark sites comparing the two chips, Ryzen 5 1400 vs Ryzen 3 3200 G it seems the Ryzen 3 3200G is stronger than the 5 1400? But also other streamers don't have problems with these chips anyways.\n\nThe R5 1400 is better than the 3200G, it may seems like the 3200G must be a lot better because it's a 2019 CPU vs a 2017 one and because it's third gen Ryzen, which had big IPC improvements over the previous two generations, but the 3200G and 3400G actually use the Zen+ architecture and are manufactured on the 12nm node, for all intents and purposes they should be considered second gen parts.\n\nSecond gen Ryzen was only a modest improvement over the first gen, and while the 3200G does have a higher clock speed and higher IPC than the 1400, it also has a gimped L3 cache due to it being an APU, and more importantly, it has no SMT, which means it has 4 cores 4 threads instead of 4 cores 8 threads. In simple terms, the 3200G is a bit faster per core but the 1400 can handle more stuff simultaneously better than the 3200G can, which is exactly what a streamer needs, and sacrificing a little bit of single core performance is an acceptable trade-off, specially considering how most modern games benefit from having more than 4 threads.\n\nUserbenchmark should never be used as a reliable benchmark because of how biased they are towards single core performance, this was a change they made to benefit Intel CPUs over Ryzen but it's so ridiculous that they even list a few i3s as being faster than i9s just because they have a tiny bit more single core performance. They're even blacklisted from r/Intel, that's how bad they are.\n\nLeaving the CPU aside, the GPU is pretty decent at 1080p, not a best by any means but it's motherfucking vanilla Minecraft we're talking about, not something like RDR2, it should have no trouble getting over 100 fps even at the highest settings. AMD does have some performance issues at OpenGL games on Windows, so Minecraft doesn't perform as well as it should on AMD hardware, but still, she isn't even using a shader and you can run vanilla Minecraft even on an Intel HD, which is the bottom of the barrel as far as GPUs goes.\n\nSomething is obviously wrong either with the PC or with how OBS is set up, my theory is that she's using software encoding and the 1400 is not strong enough to handle that on top of Minecraft and Live2D, so it should be pushed to a constant 100% usage resulting in the mess we just saw. My other theory is that they could be drivers issues or a problem with the hardware configuration being extremely bad outside of the CPU and GPU. If the problem were with OBS eating up all CPU resources, switching to GPU encoding would solve the issue.\n\nI guess she's tech illiterate and the manager is as well. In her case I wouldn't blame her because it's not her job to sort out technical problems, and the manager was probably trying to be helpful by lending his PC to her, but didn't really knew what he was doing and wasn't able to make sure that she could actually use that PC to stream. I don't exactly blame him either but maybe I should, I don't know what exactly a Cover manager's job is but helping their talents with tech issues is something they should be capable of.", "Man, it's been a hot second since I've remembered that AMD has that VCE thing. I've never actually heard of anyone using it, so I've forgotten it exists.\n\nI wonder if using that to encode in OBS would have solved her problem.

She's said herself she doesn't understand PCs very well, so I doubt she's gone into OBS settings and jumped through hoops to make AMD hardware encoding work..

At x264 medium and slow, quality has general parity with nvenc, and encoding at 6,000kbps (twitch's limit under normal circumstances) is pretty easy for a good ryzen. Twitch's less-supported complete cap is 8,000kbps, with YouTube's streaming caps at 10,000kbps. A 3600 should manage these just fine even if you have to drop to x264 fast, and nobody's going to bat an eyelid at that in a streaming contest. \n\nIf you were also looking into local recording for editing use at significantly higher bitrates like 25,000-45,000kbps, *then* a 3600 might start to sweat.

It's better to have low expectations and then blow those expectations away."], "2020-10-08": ["Nvidia drivers aren't bad they are just proprietary. It's only the FOSS or death zealots that push the whole AMD is better because they are open source. I have both AMD and nvidia graphics cards and I am new to owning them as until 12 months ago I had never owned one before.\n\nI will get roasted for saying what I'm about to but here is my personal experience.\n\nNvidia is easier than AMD to setup and configure because when you install the nvidia drivers it also installs the nvidia-settings tool that is both gui and cli. With that it is easier to set things like silent {fanless} mode control leds on the card stuff like that AMD you don't need to install any special drivers unless you need opencl or something like that. But with AMD you don't get the same easy control that you do out of the box with nvidia. The drivers work extremely well it has been my personal experience that my nvidia GTX 960 is less of a headache to setup, has no screen tearing, or artifacts or audio issues that I get with my RX 580. With the AMD card there isn't any newbie friendly information out there and apps like CoreCtrl are complicated and state clearly on their site setting the wrong thing can damage your card or system. AMD just isn't as user friendly as nvidia is. \n\nTake a look here  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/j6ofhu/intel_vs_amd_radeon_vs_nvidia_foss_drivers/g7zz4gq?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3\n\nWith AMD cards you have to muck around in polkit setting and edit grub stuff like that. With nvidia you don't you just install the proprietary drivers change your settings and it's done.\n\nThis is my personal experience. YMMV.\nFor my GTX 960 all I have to do is set the resolution, set silent {fanless} mode and turn off the logo leds. Nothing more to do. With my AMD RX580 I have to edit polkit to allow CoreCtrl to run without a password, edit grub files to make it work on boot up, then figure out what settings actually work to have fanless mode. I have never had any success in doing so. CoreCtrl just keeps the fans running at full speed all the time regardless of what I try. \n\nTake a look here https://gitlab.com/corectrl/corectrl/-/wikis/home#wiki-index\n\nI have the opinion of each to their own. Use what you want AMD if you do not want proprietary or nvidia is an option if you don't care either way. Just don't believe the propoganda that AMD is better just because it's open source. The nvidia drivers are great and work fine. They could be better if they were open source but just because they are not does not make them worse than AMD.\n\nIf you are looking for user experience then NVIDIA is easier and there is a lot more helpful and easy to follow information out there. With AMD you'll just get pointed to the Arch wiki and left to work it out for yourself.\n\nAnother link\n\nhttps://youtu.be/6T_-HMkgxt0", "If anything, that would be brought up as conclusive evidence of AMD's conspiracy to mislead their audience.\n\n\"Look at this picture.

Most people or companies dont want to take the risk of jumping on a Hypetrain and just want a product that works.\n\nAMD is still rather a underdog in this but is starting to get the train rolling.\n\nThink about it this way, China could make a watch to the exact same spec as a Rolex, but people are not going to buy the Chines watch, because they dont have confidance in it.\n\nIn other words the price for Intel is not the product but the confidance of it.

Intel however, can push up to or even beyond 4800MHz RAM with similar performance gains as extreme memory overclocking with Ryzen, but people would be more inclined to buy a high speed memory kit from G.Skill and enable the XMP profile rather than using a memory calculator to find out timings and speed and other bullshit to tune memory for Ryzen in the BIOS.", "Would be hilarious if valve and AMD did collab and you would get a free half life 3 copy if you bought new zen 3.", "1.

Just go to the r/Dell and search for XPS issues. I basically sold my XPS 15 because it couldn't sleep properly - that was 3 generations past, I went and asked r/Dell and yep the latest gen STILL has this issue as well as wavemaxx audio crackling.

I don't have any experience with super fast RAM, but in the past I have seen benchmarks where in more CPU intensive games where the CPU gets hit harder than other games, getting a much higher speed kit on Intel would improve its performance much like getting a heavily tuned low latency kit for AMD Zen 2 CPUs. But of course, getting higher quality memory kits is not the best value per dollar and it's why most people end up buying a 2x8GB 3200MHz CL16 kit for cheap, but fasterand better tuned memory does make a difference no matter what CPU you're using, but Ryzen will see more performance improvement going from 3000-3600MHz, and then almost hitting a brick wall beyond that with much less to gain than what Intel CPUs can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for learning about overclocking, I've just looked around for other forums, including this one a couple of times, and a bit of experimentation on my own hardware, within safe limits of course.

With Ryzen 5000 not offering any alternatives to entry level Zen 2, I'd imagine that Ryzen 3600 prices will not drop much, although 3700X might (since the 5600X will be a better gaming CPU).", "I'm not saying AMD should butcher good dies either but I honestly feel AMD made a mistake here in the pricing had it been $249 no one would have said a word. \n\nI get everyone's justifications I just disagree with the comparison of 5600x Vs 3600x as I firmly see the entry to the new CPU's is 50% higher than previous on release. \n\nThey share the same naming scheme yes but the 5600x at release is the entry point to Zen 3 just as the 3600 was with Zen 2.", "I'm no young whipper snapper so content creation means very little to me. \n\nI bought a 3600 at release because at the time it offered the best performance for the money. \n\nThis time round I can't whole heartedly say the 5600x does. \n\nHonestly I'd still most likely buy the 3600 as I believe AMD have in some respects a better feature set with PCIe 4 already. Although I feel Intel offerings Vs Zen 3 might now offer better value per dollar.", "Since you edited your comment to add the second paragraph, I'll say this:\n\nI think you meant to compare different CPUs. If we're comparing the 3800X vs the 5600X, on AMD's own website, the 3800X boosts up to 4.5GHz vs the 5600X's 4.6GHz. Not quite a 10% improvement in clocks, but just over 2%.\n\nSecondly, although base clock is pretty meaningless nowadays, the 5600X only has 3.7GHz vs the 3800X's 3.9 which is giving me a hunch that the multi-core boost clocks might not be as high as we might dream them to be. Remember, the best chips go to the higher SKUs.\n\n[https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-3800X](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-3800X)\n\n[https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-5600x](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-5600x)\n\nAnd I don't really want to get into the long discussion of how increases in IPC (especially first party claims of IPC increases) never translate to the same (or any) across the board increases in application performance , so we have to see how it performs in each application from 3rd party benchmarks before jumping to any conclusions.

AMD is not on top in basicly everything and they know they can increase their margins over this holiday season. The performance increase is big enough thats its kinda acceptable.\n\nFact is that most people don't upgrade gen on gen so allot of Zen 2 buyers were skipping Zen 3 completley or atlest for a while.

No one expected TSMC 7nm become an excellent process node two years ago. \n\nPeople may wait for zen 4 on 5nm node to get another R5 3600 equivalent. but still i think history will hardly repeat as both AMD and TSMC are much more confident.\n\nGood news is 3600 and 3700x are still on the market. They are still excellent processsors. You can still buy them at cheaper prices than already lower MSRP.\n\nFor microprocessor users, its a great time to be alive!", "I am sure AMD is excited that Intel gets to compete as the budget option for once. \n\nThese prices are fine. $50 price hike, bring it on. There is always a premium at the top, this could if been much much worse. Look at Nvidia's 20 series. \n\nLet's hope Intel eventually starts actually competing again or else the next time the prices might not be fine.", "Yeah I think you should've clarified that. Cause entry usually mean the lowest of the stack on the lineup.

Last Christmas I wanted to buy a PC but my dad isn't the richest person so it was to be under $700, he said. I gave him 3 options to choose. One was $790, the second was $580 and the last was $520. He didn't want to spend that much money so he went onto Etsy and found a $480 PC that was a complete scam. It had no video card, a Mini ATX board and 8G of RAM, all totaled to be around $200 worth. So on my birthday, the eighteenth of Sept, I got a video card for my PC, a GT 1030 for $100. A month later I go to turn on my computer and it doesn't work so I get it looked at and one of the screws on the motherboard wasn't put in or something causing the motherboard to fizzle out. So now I'm taking the chance to build a decent PC to run games like Apex Legends, Minecraft, Factorio, some browser games and Ark Survival Evolved.

It should be around $100 - $250 and AMD Ryzen 5 3600 with 16G of RAM and my GT 1030. Any better parts or used maybe would be greatly appreciated.

Same problem for a hypothetical 5700, which would use the same 8-core chiplets as the 5950X.\n\nSo by selling a 5600 and 5700 they would not have enough chiplets for 5900X and 5950X, which would reduce profits and piss of premium customers, while still not having enough supply of 5600 and 5700, thus pissing off customers looking for good value as well.\n\nSo instead AMD made the 5600X and 5800X less attractive by rising prices by a lot: So now they have far less demand on the low end (and better profits per unit sold) and enough supply on the high end.

There is no need for an after market cooler unless you want to overclock, and overclocking Ryzen 3000 series CPUs is just not worthwhile. The other situation where you might want an aftermarket cooler is if you are doing heavy multi-threaded workloads like video editing in which case the stock CPU cooler may get a bit louder than you would like for extended periods of time.\n* **Motherboard:** Cheapest standard ATX B550 motherboard with RGB headers and solid VRMs. It is worth paying the premium for B550 over B450 here because B550 has PCIe 4.0 which will likely become important for GPUs and SSDs in the next couple of years. \n* **Memory:** 3600mhz CL16 is the price/performance sweet spot for Ryzen 3000 CPUs. 16GB standard.\n* **SSD:**  Cheapest 1TB TLC NVMe SSD with a DRAM cache and a 5 year warranty. There will be no difference between this SSD and a 970 Evo in gaming. The 970 Evo only makes sense if you are going to be doing write-heavy work like video editing. In the future you will probably want to add a 4th gen NVMe SSD, but right now they are extremely expensive and there likely won't be any games that can utilize it for at least a year or two, by which time prices will be more reasonable. \n* **Case:** You do not want to use the case you selected because it has very little surface area for air intake. On a high-wattage PC like this one, airflow is quite important. The TD500 a mesh front panel for high airflow, a tempered glass window, and three addressable RGB intake fans.\n* **Headset:** The Stinger is a good low-budget headset, but if you can afford it, it really makes sense to upgrade to a model with better sound and microphone quality.", "[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/cFyTW3)\n\n|Type|Item|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/9nm323/amd-ryzen-5-3600-36-thz-6-core-processor-100-100000031box)|$199.99 @ Amazon|\n|**Motherboard**|[ASRock B550 Phantom Gaming-ITX/ax Mini ITX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ftdrxr/asrock-b550-phantom-gaming-itxax-mini-itx-am4-motherboard-b550-phantom-gaming-itxax)|$169.99 @ Amazon|\n|**Memory**|[Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3600 CL18 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/VNJtt6/corsair-16-gb-2-x-8-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-cmk16gx4m2d3600c18)|$62.99 @ Amazon|\n|**Storage**|[Crucial P1 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/pxKcCJ/crucial-p1-1tb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-ct1000p1ssd8)|$104.99 @ Adorama|\n|**Video Card**|[Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2060 6 GB OC Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/KX66Mp/gigabyte-geforce-rtx-2060-6-gb-oc-video-card-gv-n2060oc-6gd)|$319.99 @ Newegg|\n|**Case**|[Metallic Gear Neo Mini V2 Mini ITX Desktop Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/CJwkcf/metallic-gear-neo-mini-v2-mini-itx-desktop-case-mg-ne210_sr02)|$59.99 @ Newegg|\n|**Power Supply**|[EVGA GD (2019) 600 W 80+ Gold Certified ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Xgwkcf/evga-gd-2019-600-w-80-gold-certified-atx-power-supply-100-gd-0600-v1)|$79.99 @ Newegg|\n|*Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts*|||\n|Total (before mail-in rebates)|$1007.93||\n|Mail-in rebates|\\-$10.00||\n|**Total**|**$997.93**||\n|Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2020-10-13 01:36 EDT-0400|||", "Sure it's possible.

The 3700X comes with an RGB cpu cooler which is fine unless you want to overclock.\n* **Motherboard:** Cheapest B550 motherboard with three fan headers, four memory slots, wifi, and solid VRMs. You want B550 rather than B450 for maximum upgradeability. This motherboard has the best VRMs of any entry-level motherboard ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuPH9pCCK-E&amp;t=17m55s)), giving you the strongest upgrade path and best CPU performance. I've added a PWM splitter cable so that all front fans can connect to the same fan header. \n* **Memory:** 3600mhz CL 16 is the price/performance sweet spot for 3000 series cpus. 16GB standard. \n* **SSD:** Cheapest 1TB TLC NVMe SSD with a 5 year warranty. No need for anything more than this since you are just using this PC for gaming. \n* **HDD:** Standard choice at 2TB.\n* **Video Card:** Strongest GPU that fits the budget.\n* **Case:** Cheapest case with an open mesh front panel for high airflow, 3 RGB intake fans, and a tempered glass window. The other popular option is the Phanteks P400A. Both cases come in white or black. \n* **Power Supply:** 10 year warranty. [Tier A](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/1116640-psucultists-psu-tier-list/) PSU recommended for high-end gaming PCs. 650W is more than enough for this 394W PC while leaving plenty of room for future upgrades. Modular for easier cable management. 80+ gold efficiency.\n* **Monitor:** This is currently the best 1440p IPS panel monitor (see the Hardware Unboxed [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n9OKgCtPF8&amp;t=5m6s)). It is a is a clear cut above competitors like the Acer Nitro and Asus Tuf thanks to its impressively low gray-to-gray response time.\n* **Keyboard:** Cheapest keyboard with \"Red\" type mechanical switches, a tenkeyless layout, and with backlit keys. You want Red switches because they are generally considered the best type for gaming due to their linear action and quiet sound profile. Tenkeyless keyboards (no numpad) are preferred among gamers because the board is shorter and you therefore have more room for the mouse.\n* **Headset:** One of the top two budget gaming headsets according to the in-depth reviews by [Rtings.com](https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/best/by-usage/gaming#recommendation_142288).", "Always glad to help \ud83d\ude0e\n\nI wouldn't worry honestly if your willing to jump on them on the first few days \n\nAMD and vendors have hinted that there will be more than sufficient inventory for those who want a CPU. I think they want to show up Intel where stock of the 10600k and 10900k was non existent for almost 4+mo  Also there is no guarantee that Zen4 will be in X570 or even AM4 as they only promised through 2020 socket compatibility.", "The Ryzen 3600X and 3800X are pretty useless because of the 3600 and 3700X (almost identical performance, but more expensive).\n\nI guess AMD didn't release the 5600 and 5700X, since they're now at the top. In case one of Intels CPUs becomes a budget beast they probably release the 5600 and 5700X.\n\nKeep in mind that this is pure speculation and you probably buy a different CPU before AMD announces those (if they exist)", "I don't really see this issue. In my country the 10400F (145\u20ac) costs a tiny bit more than the 3300X (139\u20ac) and the 10400 (162\u20ac) about the same as the 3600 (165\u20ac). Since the introduction of the 5000 series does not mean that the 3000 processors are discontinued, AMD does already have a decent budget lineup. Since 500 series boards can run all the current cpus i don't think AMD feels like they have to release a complete lineup every year since backwards compatibility and the market will do the job for them. I guess that AMD releases the top tier cpus first because that is where they have some catching up to do - and it's where the most margin is made.", "A few percent here and there isnt beating if you ask me. Remember when Zen2 was up against coffee-lake-refresh (9th series), the roles where flipped, amd was behind in gaming a few percent (with exceptions like farcry e.g) and still was considered to finally be on the same level. With the new pricing model of AMD, they are clearly not the most bang for the buck anymore, thats intel (10700K vs 5800X). That doesnt change the fact that made me switch to AMD last year, after over a decade of intel only, the security issues with their hardware on a hardware level. I really could feel the performance hit on my i7 6700K after every \"patch\". So it is quite irritating that i have to pay over 100 bucks more for the same 8 cores compared to last years 3700X offer. But zen2 was always just a placeholder for me, so, cant change it. Not happy with it, but thats just how economics work. Plus if you bought some AMD stock papers, they should give you a bigger gain in just on year, so its ok i guess.", "Everyone keeps complaining about the prices as if gaming was the ONLY thing of value.\n\nA 5600X does look a bit like a poor value if all you do is game, but if you do much of anything else, it stomps the equivalent Intel and has better value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get it, some people basically only value gaming, but AMD is pricing this for everyone, not just gamers.", "&gt; HOWEVER AMD needs a $200 CPU that is where the money is. \n\nThat's where the volume is. How much capacity do you think AMD has considering they're doing Radeon 6000, Zen 3 and *two consoles*, all on 7nm, all at the same time. \n\nWhat AMD *needs* is more capacity, not a low-margin chip a that will cause massive demand that they can't hope to meet.", "What?

It worked great for the games I played and started really building a nice fan base around that. One of my best friends has that exact CPU and I know from experience the best thing you can do to make that thing flourish is get really really fast RAM. That CPU thrives on it. If there is any upgrade I would do to this pc for you would be that because the rest of your system should be fine! If you got any questions just let me know I\u2019ve been streaming for ab 2 years now and have had a wide array of setups from extra budget to high end", "I think AMD didn't release and won't release a 5700X because it will probably get confused with the 5700XT", "I'd expect 16:10 on the rest of the X series and slightly smaller bezels to go with it.\nI would like to see a full range of AMD models. I would think they will get USB 4 when it's ready not ThunderBolt, I don't know whether USB 4 is going to be available in 2021.\nI would like to see ThunderBolt or USB 4 with power delivery and displayport alt mode on all models, preferably at least 2 such ports, and 2 USB A.\nIf we extrapolate the AMD 5xxx desktop CPUs announced last week to the (presumably coming in 2021) AMD 5xxx laptop CPUs then they're going to bring another good performance boost over AMD 4xxx Renoir.\nLatest Intel yada yada.\nGiven some of the laptop trends of smaller batteries, switch to M.2 drives, then what I would really like to see across all the models is 2x DIMM slots, 1 x NVMe, and a second NVMe slot at 14\" and above. I just think soldered RAM is stupid on expensive laptops.", "You're right. I actually didn't notice that it's mostly sold out in the EU as well.\nThat either means that AMD just can't make enough of them and has no other choice than to leave the field to Intel or they don't care enough and believe that people will buy the 3600 or 3100 instead.", "LoL check the cinebench scores of the AMD presentation, the 6 core zen3 cant beat a 8 core zen 2 in multicore. 8c/16t is still the sweetspot for gaming since 2019, the more titles are making use of those cores, the more a 6 core will fall behind a 8 core, no matter the single thread advantage. 5600X is in no way a upgrade option for 3700X and even 2700X users.", "&gt; And thats one of the big reasons that they will never truly be competitive\n\nIntel has a market share of like what? 80% on all Steam PCs? And it was even more for the last years. \n\nIntel has had the fastest CPUs for years now, only losing to the new Zen 3.

How gullible can you be to trust those cherrypicked AMD ones.

They likely chose those games since they benefited the most from moving to a 8 core ccx. in titles that are already optimized somewhat for zen 2, the difference is much smaller ~5%. \n\ni think the final verdict on Zen 3 gaming performance is heavily going to depend on the suite of games that a reviewer chooses. No one includes LoL in their tests and far fewer include CSGO - two games that AMD says will have a huge advantage.", "What makes you think that?

If it's as good as AMD claims it to be, I'll most likely get one. If it's just 5% better, as I suspect it will be, Intel will have better value.", "For gaming, it will be 5% better (AMD isn't claiming otherwise). For other things, it will be more. \n\nIntel won't have better value in anything except for possibly gaming, and even that's questionable once you take into consideration motherboard+cooling+CPU costs.", "Given their slightly higher price than Intel, it wouldn't surprise me that as soon as Intel reveals 11th gen, AMD drops prices on Ryzen 5000.", "What else do you do with a 6 core that AMD beats Intel in value?", "Yes, but consumers are notoriously dumb. That's why they bought massive amounts of Pentium 4 chips with high GHz numbers on the box. They're going to be dumb here too and buy slower, higher cost 10700K chips instead of the 5600X simply because they want the number \"8\" on the side of the box.\n\nAMD could rectify this by releasing a slower 8 core 5700X around the same price as the 10700K, up to $400. Or they could make the current 8 core into a \"5700X\" and then put out a 10 core \"5800X\" at the $449-499 price point. I know for sure I'd buy an 8 core Zen 3 at $380, but I won't spend $449 it's just too much even if it's the fastest chip in the world for gaming. So instead I'll spend $299, and AMD will lose out on 80 bucks.\n\nAMD seems content to allow Intel to have a monopoly over the $330-400 range.

If some number of the CUs or possibly part of the GDDR6 memory controller or the ROPs are defective, AMD can possibly do what NVIDIA's doing with the 3080 versus the full GA102 and still sell the chip.\n\n...The drivers indicate that both GDDR6 and HBM2 are supported, so. If the HBM2 controller is defective at all, they'll have to use GDDR6 I imagine, but a defect on just one part of the GDDR6 controller could possibly let them go with 192-bit, or. If none of the rest if the die is defective, they could actually sell those dies with HBM2?\n\nMy assumption is that the full uncut Navi21 will fall somewhere between RTX 3080 and 3090, with HBM2 instead of GDDR6, if they use HBM2's power savings to up core clocks, and if they use HBM2E to up bandwidth, but that AMD will almost certainly price such a card up into the ~$1000 2080Ti-3090-ish range.\n\nBut it's occurring to me that, if they don't actually need the GDDR6 controller for that but it's on the die anyway. Being able to sell partly-defective dies for a grand would honestly be kinda slick.\n\nBut anyway, I feel like there's other parts of the die that, if defective, would just sorta break it and make it unusable?

AMD are developing entirely new cache technology and presumable hardware ray tracing themselves.\n\nRather than having to support just two resolutions in the pre 900 series market, 720p and 1080p, we're now at the point where people want cards that can handle 1080p/60/120/240, as well as 1440p/60/120-144 and 4K 60/120-144.\n\nSupport for native encoding and recording has been gobbled up, so parts of new GPUs now have to be dedicated to that, too.\n\nAll of this adds cost, if not per card in all cases then certainly in research and design.\n\nAs a result, prices of higher end cards have been rising quite quickly over the last 5 years at least.

And the fact that Nvidia pushes the card to such high watts with almost no OC potential speaks for itself.

The 20% to 30% numbers are ridiculous, but 40% isn't. \n\nIf AMD is chasing similar margins, I don't see why they wouldn't be able to price these 3080 competitors (that won't likely be full dies either) at the 600-630 USD mark. I'd love to see them hit the $599 number just for the disruptive aggresiveness that price would scream starting with a 5, but I can see them pricing at $630 too just fine.

Honestly, it's hard to find 'good' times, as there's often something improved coming out or just about to come out.\n\nI think we are looking at a lull in the hardware cycles around January.  Big Navi from AMD on the GPU front will have been out.  The 30 series will be out from NVIDIA.  AMD's new CPU and Intel's will have been out for a bit too.  That will give the GPU and CPU markets time to calm down.  You should see drops in the last generation of product prices and a stabilizing effect on the current gen as supplies become more readily available.\n\nIf you need something now, it's almost always wiser to get a last generation piece of hardware for a more reasonable cost.\n\nAs far as the 3800x goes, it's really not worth getting it unless you can get it at the same price as the 3700x.  The 3800x is just a well binned 3700x, so you can see overclocks from the 3700x which are just as good as the 3800x.  It's literally the same chip.\n\nAs far as the 3300x goes, it's the best bang for the buck at the moment.  However it is 4c/4t, and when programmers get on board with using more cores/threads effectively you'll be putting yourself at a deficit.  Especially if you're planning to keep the chip for more than 2+ years.  Also worth bearing in mind is that if you're just playing a game, 4c/4t is fine, but when you start running voice chats, streaming, IE's (with multiple tabs), music or some other programs in addition to your existing game the system can easily saturate 4c/4t CPU processes.  It's at this time that a 6c/6t CPU like the 3600 starts look a lot better.\n\nSo what it ultimately comes down to, after all that wall of text, is how badly you need a new rig right now and how much you want to spend.\n\nFor budget, I'd suggest this: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/r3QccT  Roughly $650 with the CPU included. (PCP doesn't have a price for the 3300x)\n\nFor a more realistic long term build I'd suggest this: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Hd4W4n  About $940, using a 2070S as a place holder for the 3070.  The 3070 is priced about the same as the 2070S (projected at this time), and is expected to perform (according to NVIDIA) better than the 2080ti.", "Solved it - disable C-States and disable CPB - core performance boost.

The difference between the best Intel chip and the current best AMD chip is about 10%.  The cost difference though...\n\nThat's where the rub is. Intel has been loosing ground to AMD for the last 3 years or so when it comes to cost/performance ratio.  The 2000 series of processors started the process, and the 3000 series which released last year really kicked it into high gear.  Intel has had some issues with design and manufacturing for their smaller node size and the die issues have made them loose a lot of ground.\n\nAMD is by far the better choice when it comes to bang for the buck.  And it is expected to become more so with the next generation of CPUs later this year.  The only counter Intel has to this is that they provide better single core performance which is very helpful in gaming.  Most people don't find that argument compelling enough to overcome the price difference though.\n\nWhen you match the best GPU (the NVIDIA 3080 is currently the best released but the 3090 is not far away, and AMD has their new Navi cards coming out before the end of this year too) with the best AMD and best Intel chips, you find that the CPU is the bottleneck for performance, not the video card.  However, the differences are minor and not noticeable for most gamers outside of benchmark testing.\n\nAn enthusiast system today is either 10900k with a 3080 GPU on a z490 motherboard (Intel set up), or the $100-150 cheaper 3900x with a 3080 GPU on an x570 motherboard (AMD setup).

AMD is about to release new GPUs and CPUs, this will cause a market change.  The GPUs are not expected to be able to beat out the NVIDIA 3000 series, but definitely put AMD in a competitive position.  The CPUs ARE expected to beat Intel's current best offerings.\n\n2. Both Intel and AMD are on their last generation of motherboards and CPU sockets.  Both CPU manufacturers are expected to move to a new socket and new motherboard with their next generation of chips, so the upgrade path beyond the current generation is non-existent.  The change in motherboards and CPU socket is driven by several things but primarily that DDR5, the new RAM, is expected to be released next year.  Perhaps mid to late 2021.  The standard for DDR5 was approved this past summer.\n\n3.  The holidays may afford you an opportunity to pick up some bundles that are discounted of last generation hardware.  That may be a budget answer but you're not likely to see any significant discounts on Cyber Monday/Black Friday.  However by the beginning of the year the markets may have settled down some and the holiday push will be over.\n\n5.  Lastly, the prices of some things are pretty stable.  Cases, power supplies and peripherals.  Those are worth watching for sales on.  RAM prices are expected to continue dropping through the rest of the year, as are drive costs.  The new PCIe gen 4 SSDs are massively overkill for most people, and expensive besides.  But some people are considering them for the future of their gaming rigs because of the expectation of PCIe gen 4 GPUs communicating directly with the drives to improve system performance.", "Yes, you can overclock with the stock fan if you wanted to also, as long as you have something to keep temps under control. for Intel I only used the MOBO BIOS to tweak the voltage and multiplier.

So I put my 1080ti back in....\n\nGoing back to an old game, Anarchy Online, a DX9 title (used to be DX7 before the \"new engine\") and I couldn't believe my eyes. The 1080ti looks like complete fucking shit. The space ship textures were so low quality, it was basically just two colors. The ground around that ship, again, just two colors. YET ON THE RADEON VII, the textures were full HD. Now the very odd part, everything CLOSE to my player model, was low resolution in terms of textures. AND YET, shit half way crossed the map, is HD! WHAT? Shouldn't it be the other way around? Now some might blame this on settings. So I went through changing every fucking setting you can imagine. And nothing fixes it. The other issue, now I have to play the game in windowed mode. Because for some reason on the 1080ti, the game things I am playing on a 4:3 resolution! WHAT? its 1920x1080, how is that 4:3? And there is no way to set a custom ratio. Literally the ONLY FIX is to run in windowed mode.... INSANE.\n\nMeanwhile, back on my AMD card, all the textures were HD close and far. there were no fucked up textures. No glitches, no errors. And I could play fullscreen without it being 4:3 streched.... now why, why in god fucking hell, does the 1080ti fuck up so bad. Every \"newer\" game has no issues, but older games are just absolutely ignored.\n\nTHEN, when you zoom out, all of the player models on the NVidia card goes into 2fps mode, where it looks like a fucking slide show. MIND YOU, I AM GETTING 80FPS, but for some reason when zooming out, the character models moving looks like a slide show. zoom back in, smooth motion. zoom out. fucked. then remembering my AMD card, I could zoom out as much as I wanted, it never reduced the player model movement to some low fps slideshow looking bullshit. It would be smooth no matter what.\n\nAnd the clincher.... even though its an old game, I can admit, no the Radeon VII, in the noob zone, facing the same direction as the 1080ti, I would get 30fps, while on Nvidia it would get 80fps.... now you might be saying \"its an old game, why doesn't it get more fps on AMD\" well the answer there is the way the game is coded and so on. Hell, the hardcore fps cap was 100fps. you can't go over it regardless of your pc settings. But still. I would rather get the 30fps from AMD rendering everything max textures and max resolution, than Nvidia trying to render less.....\n\nDONT GET ME STARTED ON HDR. Because when I first got the Radeon VII, testing HDR vs the 1080ti, the Radeon VII had no banding issues, meanwhile the Nvidia card had issues with red and blue banding. Sure white to grey to black there was no banding, and oddly GREEN had no banding. But red and blue had banding issues. Its almost a MEME at this point (green being nvidia, red being amd, and blue being intel, in a meme state). Meanwhile same monitor, same DP1.4 cable, same settings, the Radeon VII did perfect HDR no banding in any color, same test videos, same content..... Insane.\n\nI can't wait to buy big navi and get the fuck away from novideo. I can't stand it. Having owned both brands since forever, even having other brands most never heard of way back when (matrox) I am just done with Nvidia. If my radeon vii didn't die, I would still be using it.... and its my first gpu to die ever. And im pretty sure it was the HBM memory module that died. Because most games using less than 8gb of vram had no issue. Warzone crashed, but I ended up setting .5 for the memory allocation in the INI file, which meant using only 8gb of vram, staying away from that bad chip. HOWEVER, in COD Cold War, it was using up to 11-12gb of vram for whatever reason. And sure enough, I crashed every match, either right as it stops or right as it ends. Every time. And eventually it caused the gpu to die completely. put it into 2 other systems, no screen. tried different monitors and cables just to be double sure, again, no picture. now im on the 1080ti, same cable, same monitor, and its running, but it looks like complete fucking shit.....\n\nAMD, bring me home.", "Hmm, so does this mean that AMD is going for a 3080/3090 split where you pay a lot extra for a tiny bit more (the 8 extra CUs on the 6900XT vs the 6800XT)?\n\nBased on the info we're given, it seems like AMD is trying hard to match all levels of NVidia GPU offerings. I would be very impressed if they can get the 6900XT to at least beat the 3080 and would preorder ASAP if that ends up being the case. \n\n(And yes, I know that preordering isn't the greatest, but I'm forced to buy AMD since I run macOS, and I've been sitting on a 1070 for almost 5 years so I'm quite desperate for an upgrade)", "We don't know how it works AMD RT. So far there is no one gpu can use AMD RT - We dont know nothing about AMD version DLSS (if AMD has one?). So No wonder no game supports AMD RT yet.", "Logically this makes little sense. It implies that everyone was targeting 2080 Ti tier performance for the flagship cards of the hardware succeeding the 2080 Ti.\n\nNow if AMD was so far behind that they couldn't do better, OK, believable. But this implies that AMD wasn't expecting Nvidia to deliver anything significant beyond the 2080 Ti, and that Nvidia did a late-game flagship upgrade to catch AMD off-guard.\n\nThe rumor only makes sense if we assume everyone in charge at Nvidia and AMD are (a) incompetent idiots, and also (b) competent industrial spies. It doesn't pass the smell test.", "Without performant RTX AMD is doa at the high end. And I don\u2019t buy their current implementation as rumored using TMUs+shaders to process Ray intersections is performant enough.\n\nThe big issue is that you can\u2019t concurrently issue normal rasterization and ray intersection queries. As we see in Turing the ability to co issue int and FP instructions simultaneously can boost performance 30%+ in games that support it. \n\nI also don\u2019t trust AMD\u2019s software team to have as performant a BVH implementation. Nvidia has multiple teams of PhDs working on ray tracing and actively recruits at top schools whereas I\u2019ve never seen a job ad for graphics research scientist at AMD.", "There is no such thing as \"AMD or Nvidia RT\" anymore, from the perspective of the developer (we're no longer in the vendor extension-only dark age of HWRT). It is now abstracted away by DXR and Vulkan's provisional raytracing extensions against which developers write their hardware-enabled raytracing global illumination systems (hybrid or otherwise).\n\n**The problem here is that this takes significant brain power and time to implement. So CDPR opted to license Nvidia's implementation RTXGI from the GameWorks suite which depends on DLSS 2.0 to work**, which disqualifies AMD hardware for obvious reasons (yes, AMD hardware now has some inference-friendly instructions in RDNA2 but Nvidia doesn't care)", "I can see this being an issue out of the gates, but hopefully things should start to pick up for people who are considering/committed to purchasing AMD's new line up. \n\nOne thing that should really help AMD's case on this is that the new console generation is being based on RDNA 2. Hopefully we'll get to see it being picked up quickly, though I too wouldn't bank any hopes on it.\n\nWhilst I'm still firmly with Intel and Nvidia currently, less technologies being locked behind a brand will always be better for us consumers - even if it does need some extra time to roll out.", "Now that AMD is kind of back to its traditional naming scheme, it is worth remembering that AMD often names its products based on where they think the card slots against the competition\n\nFor instance, the x900 cards have always gone against Nvidia's high end, e.g. X1950XTX, 7970, etc. So if they are indeed coming out with a 6900XT, they think they have at least a 3080 competitor\n\nThe x800 cards then are the ones that are competitive against the high end but clearly a but lower, e.g. the HD4870\n\nThen the 700s are those cards better than mainstream but not competitive against the high end. Like the 5700XT\n\nI'm guessing from these names we have the 6900XT trading blows with the 3080, 6800XT somewhere between 3080 and 3070, and 6800 somewhere around the 3070 \n\nWe will probably see the 40CU 192-bit Navi 22 fill the 6700XT, 32 CU 6700, and 32 CU 128-bit Navi 22 fill the 6600XT and a 24 CU 6600", "As someone explained on /r/amd:\n\n* Cache is not cheap, in fact it's some of the most expensive memory per byte\n\n* Higher bandwidth memory is also not cheap\n\n* Since consumers don't like expensive products, and AMD wants to make money, they'll have to choose one or the other\n\n* If slower main memory with cache can achieve similar speeds to a faster main memory, you'll choose the cheaper overall option. Slow mem+great cache is probably the cheaper option\n\n* Sourcing opens another can of worms. They might not have the deals, supply, confidence, etc. in the faster memory option.", "Hmm, it'll be interesting to see how far AMD pushes ray tracing stuff\n\nI'm interested in a high end GPU but I really don't care at all about RTX, none of the games I'm interested in support it and even if they did, I'd probably turn it off since I only play multiplayer online games where the framerate matters and I don't have lots of time to appreciate the details\n\nIt would be a shame if AMD were to sacrifice lots of R&amp;D effort that could have gone into better non-RT performance to produce mediocre ray tracing (I really don't think it'll be exceptional at this point), but at the same time, as you mention, lots of people do care about the new tech and AMD shouldn't let themselves fall behind in the RT game.", "Hi /u/Bebslair,\n\nUnfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):\n\n* **All selling and buying posts must have an asking price / budget**\n\nIf you feel this was removed in error or are unsure about why this was removed then please [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FHardwareSwapUK) us.\n\n                                   \n**Please don't comment with the price / budget or edit the post as the mods won't see this.

By doing this, this way, though, you can add a GPU later at you leisure, and maybe even get a better one the 1650 super. If your finances are such adding a GPU later is hardship, you could consider the other builds here. \n\nThis build can easily take a Ryzen 3900x, with a 3070 if your ever want to upgrade, or anything less then that. Buy a cheap used 3700x in a year or 2 and now you have the same CPU as next gen consoles, slap in any GPU you want.", "The GA104 performance target seems to be correct, AMD didn't expect the return of the Thermi and 3070(full GA104) only matching 2080Ti.", "RTX 3070 will do DLSS which will give you massive gain in FPS, not sure yet if AMD will/does support this.", "Here's my bets:\n\nMy #1 safest bet is that the comparison between Ampere and RDNA2 is going to be messy as f$@k. The answer is going to be \"it depends\" when asked which is better. I don't think AMD is going to take the gaming crown \"no matter the test\", but they definitely will be a juggernaut this year finally playing ball at the high end.\n\nMy other bets:\n\n*Traditional rasterization performance?*\n\n6900 XT = Trades blows with 3090.\n\n6800 XT = Trades blows with 3080\n\n*Ray tracing?*\n\n6900 XT and 6800 XT = trades blows with 3070\n\n*DLSS?*\n\nDon't know to wager any guess.\n\n*AMD price points?*\n\n6900 XT $999\n\n6800 XT $599\n\n\\#remindme  in two weeks, or however that bot works.\n\nRay tracing will be the elephant in the room with RDNA2, not traditional rasterization performance. This is what's going to bring the value down from Ampere. Worst case is that Ampere is going to be a better rounded platform compared to RDNA2 and AMD will be back to playing the value game--just at a higher performance level which is still a solid achievement for them. Ampere will have Great RTX performance, DLSS capable, and solid-as-hell rasterization performance at a solid price. Just no stock. :)\n\nFrom the latest leaks, I don't think we can expect that RDNA2 will be very efficient anymore, so my last bet is that both platforms will be power hungry.\n\nThe possible hidden surprise is that AMD's ray tracing performance blows everyone away and defied all odds and rumors. I think what gives this some moment of thought is the fact that both the latest consoles will have hardware ray tracing with AMD guts. You'd have to think that AMD may have something up their sleeve here. But maybe not.", "All we have to do is look at history. AMD made the PS4 and last Xbox as well. People kept saying that would lead to games being optimized better for AMD on PC. It didn't happen. I doubt that the fact that PS5/XSX use RDNA 2 will make a big difference here either.", "Ye AMD only has strict Vulkan and DX12 raytracing which is worlds different approach to what Nvidia is doing.\n\nAnd yes, that needs to be implemented by the devs.\n\nOn top of that, it is much harder to implement compared to Gameworks dev tools Nvidia provides.\n\nThankfully Microsoft has taken upon themselves to develop some tools for devs if they want to implement in DX12 or on consoles. Still, it is in early stages, while Nvidia is already on the second generation.", "I may be wrong in this assumption, but I'll add it here anyway.\n\nI believe that **NOT** every game advertised with RTX branding is limited to Nvidia hardware. *Quake II RTX* is probably limited to Nvidia hardware, *Wolfenstein Young Blood* with ray tracing is also probably limited to Nvidia hardware. This is due to the fact that both were released during a time in which Vulkan only had a hardware accelerated ray tracing extension provided by Nvidia. However, these games could be updated to use the more open Vulkan ray tracing extension, or maybe Nvidia's own extension offers support for AMD. We just don't know.\n\nHowever, things like Minecraft \"RTX\" have been showing to run just fine on RDNA 2 as shown by Microsoft with a Xbox Series X demo. So not all RTX branded games will be limited to Nvidia.\n\nYou also claim that games with RTXGI require the use of DLSS 2.0 to work, ultimately making it not possible to run on AMD hardware. If that was the case, then these games also wouldn't work on the GTX 10 and 16 series GPUs which lack tensor cores to perform DLSS. It's possible Nvidia could be lying about DLSS requiring tensor cores or they may have a fallback system for GTX GPUs, but so far I haven't seen much evidence toward this.\n\n\\----------\n\n&gt;Gotta love gatekeeping black box SDKs.\n\nAccording to [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtxgi), the source for RTXGI is available for anyone that applies for it thus making it not a black box. Here's the quote directly from Nvidia:\n\n&gt;**Full Source Code**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We are providing full source code so you can easily integrate RTXGI into your tools and customize it to your specific needs.\n\nOn that same [page](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtxgi), Nvidia also claims RTXGI is fully compatible with all DXR GPUs, including the GTX 10 and 16 series. This states that RTXGI will be fully compatible with AMD GPUs when they support DXR. So, I'm not seeing how you came to the conclusion that RTXGI won't run on AMD hardware.\n\nIf both of these statements are false and are simply there to make developers feel like they're being inclusive and allowing AMD users to take advantage of RT in their game when AMD releases their DXR GPUs, then there may be legal repercussions for Nvidia. So I'm not sure why Nvidia would state them.\n\n\\-----------\n\nHowever, it should be noted that I may be getting this all wrong. I may be referencing to a different RTXGI to the one you're talking about.\n\nMaybe there's some kind of mix up. It might be that every game that incorporates RTXGI must also include DLSS. However, RTXGI may not require DLSS (thus allowing it to run on AMD and GTX hardware just fine), and it could just be a way for Nvidia to get DLSS into more games so they can have a lead over AMD.\n\nThe only way to know is to actually wait until games like Cyberpunk and the RDNA 2 GPUs get released. However, it would be interesting to see the evidence behind your statements. Because if what you've said is true, then it's a potential bad sign for AMD.", "Because they build it for AMD", "Well, Nvidia pushed ray-tracing and AMD's first ray-tracing cards aren't even out, so that's not a surprise.\n\nThat being said... despite 2 RTX generations (which were named for ray-tracing), adoption is still a joke. Very few games have it, and they're AAA cinematic blockbusters that Nvidia is probably paying to get on board due to surrounding hype.\n\nRay-tracing tanks FPS so hard that most people simply don't use it, even with DLSS. The majority of gamers won't have high end cards, they'll have 3070s and 3060s or will buy 20xx cards cheap.\n\nIt's not really that big of a deal to most enthusiasts. If I can be honest, as someone who will easily swap from Nvidia to AMD if AMD ever earns the performance crown in GPUs (and back again should it ever shift), my **bigger concern is DLSS**.\n\nRay-tracing is still kind of a marketing gimmick and isn't all that impressive, especially not for the cost, but DLSS is very exciting for gamers and more games should support that even if they don't want to use ray tracing, and AMD needs their own competitor if they ever want to be taken completly seriously.", "Honestly, AMD really needs to offer more than just performance if they want to compete with nvidia. Times are changing, it's not just about pure hardware performance anymore. Software is becoming just as important now. Look for example at DLSS and how it's starting to become more and adopted. AMD really has to work on making their product more robust .", "I think that these suggestions will hurt real customers more than bots. Bots have the patience and can offer adaptability for things that will simply annoy users. A bot for example can open multiple sessions with different user data, wait the 5 minutes for each and order several items together.\n\nI think that AMD's suggestions were quite reasonable: limit to 1 item per customer, verify that different orders don't go to the same address. That's a lot easier on normal customers than having to wait or having to manually fill account data they told the store to keep for future purchases.", "I know the AM3 CPUs quite well. If you are asking about the mismatched RAM speeds, they will work together but at the lower 1333 speed. You may be able to get them to work at 1600 by setting them manually but that may cause other problems. TBH the RAM speed on these isn't a big deal. The performance will be nearly the same at both speeds. \n\nI can speak about the GPU thing but not in context of running  a server. As a gaming rig, this will be fine for CSGO but don't expect 250 FPS out of it with any of the GPUs listed. Strictly as a server, I don't think you'll have any problems, but again I don't know how well the game runs as a server with or without a GPU. My experience is mostly with AMD/ATI cards and the ones indicated by others here will all run fine. My preference would be the RX 460/560 as they are reasonably efficient and well supported by drivers.\n\nAs to the other thing your specs have that others indicate is a problem, I, too, add to the PSU as being far too small. I would always recommend a 450W unit for a Phenom II, even a 65W dual core. This allows for adding in a GPU without having problems with power. Your 95W draws a bit more than my HTPC Athlon II 640 under load but TBH my GPU in that is the lighter and older R7 360(predates the RX 460 but similar performance). IIRc the total system draw, other than monitor is about 175W when doing its video thing and when video transcoding about 275W. I still use a 450W PSU on this set up BC over time the PSU will droop in power draw.", "&gt; How demanding are those games (Borderlands 3, COD MWF, GOW 5), compared to RDR2, AC Odyssey and other big hitters?\n\nNot sure about the rest but Borderlands 3 was one of the games Nvidia used to show off the 3080 because it runs very well on their architecture. So if AMD can match them there it probably means good things.", "I would suggest looking at the 3070s that release at the end of this month. AMD are also releasing a new lineup that might be competitive in that space early next month.\n\nWhats your power supply make and model?", "Regarding the efficency, I would wager that the Top Card is slightly more efficent than the 3080 and the others are below 300watt, since they arent as aggresivly pushed. It seems one of the biggest reasons for amperes high power usage is ddr6x, so AMD should have an advantage by using ddr6.", "I'm going to reply to this comment so I can continuously refer to your specs. I'm gonna try and keep it around $1000. If you're not in an extreme rush, you can find amazing deals at r/buildapcsales if you're patient enough. Last week I got an i9-9900k CPU which normally retails at $700 for $300. Also, to cut costs down, you can upgrade 1 or 2 parts of the pc and then sell off the old ones. I put the i9-9900k in my system and then sold my old CPU for $175 which made my total cost to upgrade my CPU only $125 for a chip that would cost $700 at msrp. So theres a lot of ways you can save money here. Anyways. If you want to stay very cheap, your gpu is pretty low end for streaming. You can get great deals (say $300-$400 for top end 20 series with cheaper options) on 20 series cards (rtx 2060, 2070, 2080, ti, super whatever) right now because a lot of people are upgrading to the new 30 series cards and selling off their used ones. EVGA also has \"b-stock\" which is refurbished but they are pretty reputable. That being said, I'm not 100% sure on your mobos compatibility and if you could use a 20 series card with it. At pcpartpicker.com they have a tool that you can put in all your system information and it will tell you if you have any compatibility issues, and then you can swap pieces in and out and see if they will fit with your system. I think you'll need to upgrade your motherboard ultimately though if you want to upgrade your other parts. Personally, if I had your build I would be on the lookout for a good motherboard and CPU first, CPUs are dropping in prices recently and may go down even more with AMDs new card coming out. You could grab a z390 mobo for like $200 and a new CPU like a 9th gen Intel chip for around $300 and then youd be set up for a 20 series gpu when you are ready to pull the trigger or you could just buy it all at once if you have the means. These upgrades, with a strong 20 series card, could probably even get you to 1440p (maybe, big maybe, low end 4k even) providing you get a nice CPU to compliment it.

For example on my ryzen 2700X I have my multiplier set to 43.5 X100 (FSB) which gives me a 4.35ghz all core clock.  You can also change your FSB and this can give you more of a fine tuned overclock. For example I could raise my fan too 101 then you get 43.5x101=4.39ghz \n My overclock was stable at 4.35ghz and I just haven't had the time to mess with it but eventually I will while waiting for MSI to realise the bios update so I can grab me a 5900X. \n\nBut though this is a easy way to overclock your voltage has to be set correctly as well this is the most important part because this is where damage can occur. For example you can set your multiplier to 55 and do no system damage because the system would just fail to boot or crash instantly but if you shoot to much voltage to your cpu it can fry it. \n\nAnd also important make sure your cooling is up to the task.", "I think Nvidia has once successfully increased performance per watt more 50% from Fermi, Kepler, Maxwell and Pascal \n\nFermi (480)--&gt; Kepler (680) (node + arch change): 112%\n\nKepler 2.0 (780 Ti) --&gt; Maxwell 2.0 (980) (Arch change): 53.8\n\nMaxwell 2.0 (980) --&gt; Pascal (1080) (Arch + node change): 58%\n\nIt's been done by Nvidia and I don't see why AMD can't pull the same stuff.

Nvidia and AMD did not compress GPU memory data at all until Maxwell, now it's absolutely critical in the industry at all power levels.\n\nThose two changes - tile-based caching with much larger caches &amp; memory compression - enormously improved the perf/watt, especially since it allowed for cutting the memory bus size and clocks down at a given performance level.", "That is a bit of a diss of the Radeon VII it isn't \\*just\\* a direct port... there were a lot of things that were worked on in Radeon VII that lead to Navi.. for instance it has the first implementation of the SMU aka System Management Unit.

Can happen easily. A game like the Tomb Raider series require mostly GPU resources. Or if you're running at higher resolutions (i.e. 1440p or 4K), then the workload is going to be much more on the GPU, so even if the CPU is maxed out, it wouldn't be limiting the performance of the GPU. \n\n&gt; Like will all 3GB of VRAM actually be used?\n\nDepends on the game. Trying to make sure that your VRAM is all used doesn't make a lot of sense. VRAM is used as it is needed.\n\n&gt; I feel like I will underutilize the GPU by at least 20% unless I overclock it\n\nMake sure you're not using a bottleneck calculator. They're worthless. \n\n&gt; Also ive seen people use an AMD A10-7850 with a 1060 and dont quite believe them when they say that the CPU overclocked doesnt cause a that bad bottleneck of the CPU\n\nWell bottlenecks are more than CPU vs GPU. Remember the situation I mentioned before - a bottleneck is a constantly moving item that changes based on the game, monitor resolution, CPU speed, GPU speed, and whether or not it even matters changes based on the refresh rate of the display. \n\nA GTX 1060 paired with a 7850K running rocketleague on a 1080p/60Hz display will still produce FPS in excess of the refresh rate of the display. So while the CPU might bottleneck the GPU, it doesn't actually matter. \n\n&gt; Finally also from my research it seems that GPU is most important for an open world game.\n\nAgain, it varies on the game. \n\n&gt; FInally I know not to use cpucompare but does a 6000 rated CPU have twice the processing powerof a 3000 one?\n\nI'm not even sure what that means.", "No that rare, Doom Vulkan in AMD GPUS pretty much cares naught what CPU you have as  long as it's not ancient.\n\nCan play 100+ FPS maxed out in 1080p with i5 4460.", "Ok so you have it kinda mixed up, the cpu (AMD Ryzen 7 3750H) has integrated graphics which im guessing ur asking which one would be faster that or the gtx 1650. the faster option is ur graphics card by the way and the answer would be the 1650 by a long shot.

A lot of people don't usually appreciate how big they are until they get the case, and then they're a PITA to return.\n\n750W PSU is a bit overkill, but given the tendency of modern GPUs to need quality, high wattage PSUs, it might not be the worst idea. RTX 3000 sucks power and the upcoming Big Navi GPUs from AMD might well be in that ballpark, though I'm hoping lower! \n\n32GB RAM just for gaming isn't necessary but if you're the kind of person to leave things open/running (we all do it) then it's justifiable, or if you want to use the PC for more than just gaming. \n\nYou're probably aware that AMD's Zen 3 CPUs are incoming, though at $450 the 5800X is reasonably expensive, and it's not as though they make Zen 2 obselete, but there is a very *very* decent uplift in gaming performance at 1080p on Zen 3.

It's looking pretty monstrous but we also don't know what SKUs AMD will be launching at what price points!

The only real value is the better CPU cooler, and you're planning to get an aftermarket cooler anyway so it is definitely not worthwhile.\n* **CPU Cooler:** The Cooler you selected silly overkill for a Ryzen 5. Additionally, liquid AIOs are only worthwhile if you REALLY like the aesthetics. On your budget, you'd be much better off using that money to buy a stronger video card.\n* **Motherboard:** Cheapest B550 or X570 motherboard with the USB C 3.2 header that is required for the case's front USB C port. The board you selected is way overpriced.\n* **Memory:** 3600mhz CL16 is the price/performance sweet spot for Ryzen 3000 cpus. Lower CAS latency (CL) is faster. 16GB standard.\n* **SSD:**  Cheapest 2TB NVMe SSD with a DRAM cache. \n* **Video Card:** You probably won't have a ton of choice on which specific 3070 model given the low availability, so I've just left an open parametric filter on this. \n* **Case:** The P400A won the overall [best case of 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u8rGgYrRZY&amp;t=2m8s) award from Gamer's Nexus (the premiere case reviewers) due to its high airflow, price, and build quality. Comes with 3 addressable RGB fans.\n* **Power Supply:** 10 year warranty. [Tier A](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/1116640-psu-tier-list-40/) recommended for high-end gaming PCs. 550W is more than enough for this 300WPC. Modular for easier cable management. 80+ gold efficiency. The PSU you selected is very expensive because it is an SFF PSU (small form factor). Additionally it only has a 7 year warranty. You would only buy that PSU if you were using a case that required it. The H210 supports ATX PSUs so there is no need for an SFF PSU.", "Thanks all these builds seem to be Intel based.. wanted to stick with AMD.", "1. Uninstall the current AMD driver. \n\n2.

I am no expert so I am just throwing it out there based on what I have experienced.\n\nWith the AIO cooler, was the protective film on the cold plate removed? I am asking because I believe this AIO comes with it and it is something that people have overlooked. You seem like an experienced builder and you did mention that temperature was high even on stock cooler, so it might be something else.\n\nWhile we are on this, is the mounting pressure correct? Again, based on my experience, I have seen coolers not being mounted correctly and it wasn't making good contact with the cpu. In most case, the builder didn't screw it down hard enough, therefore the temp jumps high real fast. This include stock cooler.\n\nI would also update the bios, install the AMD chipsets drivers, etc, which I am sure you have already considered.\n\nAnyway, not sure how useful I was, but good luck.\n\nLet us know how it went. \n\nCheer mate.", "Yep, the same thing with the 3080 leaks, showed massive gains. Now it is a hella awesome card but nowhere at what they promoted it as. I never take any stock in company released benches. Just like the 6800xt killing the 3080 by about 25%, are we sure it is not the 6900xt and they just changed the numbers? Companies do this crap all the time. I would like AMD to have a card that can actually stand up to the top end Nvidia, problem is, when they get close the drivers kill it. Same with them beating Intel now, and all the talk of Intel going down and out... 80billion in revenue each year says otherwise. Right now Intel does not have to do anything. They can keep doing 14nm, funny part of that is at 14nm the new AMD CPUs beating them, but not by much. Think if Intel got 7nm in their next gen in a year or 2....", "So unlike AMD that makes things worse an Nvidia driver actually fixed the issue at hand with no impact to the performance of the card.", "My opinion is to not get too hung up on the AMD processor.  Yes it is faster overall than an equivalent Intel chip in most work streams. Yes, you would likely only notice in a benchmark test or doing something like exporting a 4K video and timing it with a stopwatch. So what if an intel chip takes 10% or 15% longer to do something processor intensive?  It will still get the job done.  Other factors are important too.  A 16x9 screen will NEVER become a 3:2 screen no matter low long you wait.  A non-touchscreen will never become a touchscreen no matter how long you wait. A 80% SRGB coverage screen will never cover 100% Adobe SRGB no matter how long you wait. An eGPU Requiring thunderbolt (intel only) will never connect to an AMD laptop no matter how long you wait.  But will an intel laptop do every single task an AMD laptop will if you wait a bit longer?  yep.\n\nSo I\u2019d get the total package you want and consider the AMD a nice perk rather than a must have.  Again my opinion. \n\nBetween those you listed, the Samsung has the most overall hardware value. Espeicialy the RAM since none of these have upgradeable RAM and it has 50% more than the rest. It will probably have the best screen from a screen quality perspective and the screen is what you look at all day.\n\nThe Surface laptop is the one with the best trackpad an the 3:2 screen aspect is nice for most tasks like web surfing, e-mail, reading docs, etc.   But it is not a 2-in-1. This could be the deal breaker.  It is also likely the most expensive for what you get and no Thunderbolt.\n\nIf I were buying based on what I think you said your need were this is how I would rank those you listed:\n\n1. Samsung Flex\n2. HP Spectre\n3. HP Envy\n4. Microsoft Surface Laptop 3\n5. HP Probook\n\nIf you REALLY need / want a 2-in-1, then the Surface Laptop is out of the running.  I think the Probook is a bit of a lower-end machine that is thick, kind of cheaply made, and not in the same quality category as the Samsung Flex or the Spectre.", "This is a sensible 1080p build with room to upgrade:\n\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/mDCq4d)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/9nm323/amd-ryzen-5-3600-36-thz-6-core-processor-100-100000031box) | $199.99 @ Best Buy \n**Motherboard** | [ASRock B550M Pro4 Micro ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/NT7p99/asrock-b550m-pro4-micro-atx-am4-motherboard-b550m-pro4) | $104.99 @ Newegg \n**Memory** | [Team T-FORCE VULCAN Z 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/z3VD4D/team-t-force-vulcan-z-16-gb-2-x-8-gb-ddr4-3200-memory-tlzgd416g3200hc16cdc01) | $57.99 @ Amazon \n**Video Card** | [MSI GeForce GTX 1660 6 GB VENTUS XS OC Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MYMwrH/msi-geforce-gtx-1660-6-gb-ventus-xs-oc-video-card-gtx-1660-ventus-xs-6g-oc) | $204.99 @ B&amp;H \n**Case** | [Fractal Design Focus G Mini MicroATX Mini Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/vPp323/fractal-design-focus-g-mini-black-microatx-mini-tower-case-fd-ca-focus-mini-bk-w) | $56.99 @ B&amp;H \n**Power Supply** | [SeaSonic S12III 650 W 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Rxprxr/seasonic-s12iii-650-w-80-bronze-certified-atx-power-supply-ssr-650gb3) | $64.99 @ Best Buy \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $699.94\n | Mail-in rebates | -$10.00\n | **Total** | **$689.94**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2020-10-24 09:32 EDT-0400 |\n\nIt\u2019s an mATX build, but you could easily spend another $20 to make it ATX by getting the b550-A pro instead of the b550m pro 4 and getting the ATX version of the same case.", "I\u2019ve bought two AMD cards.

A 4 month window is a long time for the industry, we don't know whats readily available by then. \n\nI suggest to look at the rx 3070 and the new AMD RX cards.  If the game that your playing supports NVIDIA reflex then its better to get an nvidia card. But if you're just going for general AAA gaming then the yet to be released AMD big navi should be good too. \n\nAs for monitors there are a lot of suggestions in the subreddit already you can be more specific with the Size and refresh rate you're going for. Im using a viewsonic xg2405 @ 11,500 but then again like what i mentioned earlier we don't know if there are newer/better products when when february comes around.", "If you can hold on to your PC for a bit longer, I\u2019d recommend waiting just a few weeks for the 3070 and the things AMD has to show.", "Never had an AMD card before and I am not well versed in the differences between AMD and NVIDIA other than the idea that they are hoarding tech research. Just checked the prices. I can get the 5700XT for about 50$ more. Do you think the performance increase would be worth it?", "Yeah, AMD is currently competing with both Intel for CPUs and Nvidia for GPUs. Lately they have been pushing out some quality components at great prices. Personally, I'd say its worth the extra $50. I'd suggest looking on YouTube at some benchmark comparisons between the rx 5700 xt and rtx 2060. You might be pretty surprised.", "I've personally heard quite a few good things from the Sapphire cards. I'm not too well informed about this topic though. I'd just narrow it down to which cards fit your budget, read the reviews for each one, and go from there\n\nEdit: Yeah, I have heard of those issues. As far as I know, most of those issues were closer to launch. AMD has since released numerous driver updates and such which seemed to have helped quite a bit, as I haven't really seen any issues with the cards being posted lately.", "Seems like a fine list. I actually recommend a stronger graphics card for 1440p 144hz. \n\nDepends on how soon you need it. Nvidia just released their GPU, AMD is releasing theirs. In a couple months, there should (hopefully) be more supply, and last generation components will come down in price.", "You should wait until November 5th and watch out for all of the reviews of the new AMD CPUs, the 5000 series. A lot of rumors and leaks are pointing to that these new CPUs having better single core performance than Intel. If you want to see the release prices, here's a link:\n\nhttps://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2020-10-08-amd-launches-amd-ryzen-5000-series-desktop-processors-the-fastest-gaming", "Pc building is mainly about prioritising your components based on your requirements and budget. You did good with a lot of components. Like not going for the best case out there. I've seen others recommending better cases but if you don't have the budget for it and is looking for the best you can get out of your PC for the budget, then case is not the best upgrade you can go for. The one you've selected should be fine. \n\n The CPU choice based on today's prices is very reasonable too considering that you're getting better clock speeds and a better cooler (3600 has wraith stealth and 3600xt has wrath spire), this was a good choice as well. However, if video editing is your primary need, you could still go with an 8 core processor although this may not be a necessity. The Ryzen 3600XT is plenty powerful when it comes to performance and you're more likely to need more ram than more cores. So depending upon your workload, you're very likely to need ram upgrade to 32gb. But that can always be done later. Also if you didn't already know, if your pc does experience lag later on, open task manager and look at what is at it's max usage. Most of the time the ram is culprit for bottlenecks during heavy loads. If so, get more ram then. Your motheboard already has 4 slots, so it should be no worry.\n\n\nAs for the motherboard, the b450 ds3h is fine just for 3600/xt. Anything more and you'll need to get something better to maximize performance (and necessary power delivery). MSI tomahawk max will support much higher end CPUs (like the Ryzen 9 3950x or equivalent), if you plan on upgrading later.\n\n\nBoth GPU and PSU should be enough for your needs. As for SSD, you could preferably go for a 512gb nvme ssd from xpg sx8200 pro which is available for 7.5k. You can also save a few buck from that ram by opting for a crucial ballistix currently available for just 2.9k with 3200mhz and cl16. Another alternative is gammix d30 which can be often found for similar prices too.\n\n\nConsidering that the 3600xt already has a decent air cooler, you may not need an additional cooler. If needed, you can go for it later. You can check the temps and make a decision then. Most likely unless you're planning to over clock, the stock cooler will be plenty enough.\n\n\nMSI optic G241C is pretty much a steal if you're okay with 24in monitors. It's available right now for 17k, has a 144hz display and IPS panel with over 100% sRGB coverage for your editing needs. \n\n\nOn a side note, some of these above suggestions stand only if you're purchasing it right now, else you're welcome to wait for Ryzen 5600x and whatever new budget GPU AMD or Nvidia plans to offer.", "Wait for independent benchmarks. AMD's CPU gaming benchmarks have historically been hilariously inaccurate. Like claiming the 1700x was nearly the same as a 7700k.\n\nPlus the fact that they're claiming such big performance jumps with the same process is very dubious to begin with.", "That's what I was thinking about. I heard it was supposed to be in between 2 of Nvidia's newest GPU's. Knowing AMD I'm also hoping it's cheaper, I could also be wrong though.", "There is only 1 AMD driver.\n\nIncludes all GPU.", "Since you're looking for gaming laptop, that budget won't get you much far with it. It is very advisable to go for a gaming pc at this price point which can be a much better investment as well as provide far better gaming experience. If you really want to go for a laptop, you could. Look for gtx 1650 Graphics equipped laptops. Any of the processors should be fine at that price point. \n\nBut on a side note, the 4000 series AMD processors are far better than the Intel's competing CPUs. But the 3000 series AMD processors are slightly behind. This is true only in case of laptops. In case of PC, most Ryzen processors offer much better performance than Intel processors at the same price point starting from the very first gen ryzen processor. Since you're in 11th grade, I'm assuming portability may not be an issue in which case definitely go with a 50k pc build which will offer a much better gaming experience. I could provide a recommendation for that build if you want to go that way.", "Ok thanks. So would it be worth waiting for the new ones AMD is going to release? I heard it's really good.", "Hi man. Thanks for answering my question. Seriously your answer gave me a good insight into this. The reason I am going for a laptop is because I don't know where can I build a CPU. I would so love to build a CPU around 50k but I dearly lack the information on how to do so. Can you please help me with this problem of mine? I am really grateful of you for extending a helping hand to me. Also thank you for letting me know that AMD is comparatively better than Intel.. I would be happy to hear your recommendation for a PC build. Once again, thank you.", "Hi man. Thanks for answering my question. Seriously your answer gave me a good insight into this.

It will have very bad airflow. You should either get a case with better airflow (CM NR600, Lancool II Mesh, Phantek 400A, ...) or ones that make use of being closed, like the noise isolated be Quiet! cases, or the H510 with its alternative cooling concept.\n\nThe 2600X is not ideal for gaming build, one usually really wants the higher core performance of the Ryzen 5 3600 (or at least the 3300X if available).\n\nThe Samsung 860 Evo is usually overpriced and not attractive next to cheap M.2 NVMe drives like the Crucial P1. no difference in practice, so if you got it for a fair price that's okay.\n\nThe HDD however is a waste of money. The money spent ther could have been used to get a bigger SSD, a 1TB unit. More SSD storage is worth less overall storage, and the  difference here would have been small.\n\nGTX 1660 Super is okay if it's what fit the budget. System Power 9 is also okay, but a Pure Power 11 500W with its higher efficiency is the better choice when at the same price point. The 400W version would also have been enough for the build.\n\n[pc-kombo shared list](https://www.pc-kombo.com/de/build/Bw7GydjB)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 3600](https://www.pc-kombo.com/de/product/cpu/00730143309936) | 169.90\u20ac @ mindfactory\n**Motherboard** | [MSI B450 Gaming Plus Max, AMD B450](https://www.pc-kombo.com/de/product/mainboard/04719072658557) | 89.00\u20ac @ mindfactory\n**Memory** | [G.Skill RipJaws V Series (16 GB)](https://www.pc-kombo.com/de/product/ram/04719692004970) | 58.90\u20ac @ computeruniverse\n**SSD** | [Crucial P1 1000 GB (1 TB)](https://www.pc-kombo.com/de/product/ssd/00649528787354) | 98.35\u20ac @ reichelt\n**Video Card** | [ZOTAC GAMING GeForce GTX 1660 Super Twin Fan](https://www.pc-kombo.com/de/product/gpu/04895173619977) | 214.90\u20ac @ mindfactory\n**Case** | [BitFenix Nova Mesh Midi-Tower - schwarz](https://www.pc-kombo.com/de/product/case/04712883217197) | 44.41\u20ac @ mindfactory\n**Power Supply** | [be quiet!

That's why someone with a 7700k can't upgrade to a 10700k without upgrading from a Z390 to a Z490. AMD said they would support their current motherboards for 5 years. This is the final year. So any AMD motherboard you buy now will likely work for the release going on now but not for next years' release. \n\nAnd when you upgrade your CPU/Mobo you obviously upgrade your RAM too, since 5 years ago 8gb was the norm and now nobody goes for less than 16. Plus the speeds change and make your old RAM incompatible with the new motherboard. \n\nThe PSU can sometimes work for future builds but newer components are taking up more energy, so let's say someone has a 550W PSU but wants to upgrade their GPU to a 3080, they can't without buying a new one. That's one of the reasons it's good to buy PSU's that are a bit overkill. \n\nCases have evolved a ton in the last 5 years. The newest cases are mesh and airflow focused, with glass side panels so you can see the components. 5 years ago that wasn't really a thing. While people could build in their old cases, what's $80 more for a new mesh case with a glass side panel so you can see all your expensive parts when your old case was a black box you couldn't see inside of. \n\nMonitors can work but technology evolves so quickly. 5 years ago everyone was rocking 1080p and now 1440p/144hz is standard. Also monitors get much cheaper over time. Right now 4k monitors with high refresh rates are stupidly expensive, but in 5 years they won't be. In fact, 8k will probably become more realistic in terms of price and future GPU's will actually be able to support it.\n\nWhen people ask for upgrade advice, for gaming in particular, usually the answer is just to upgrade your GPU. If you're going to need a new CPU/Motherboard too, then you also need new RAM, probably a PSU, and then by that point you're building a whole new build so you might as well get a brand new case, etc.", "Legion 5 17\" is cheaper on the [Lenovo store](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-5-series/Legion-5-17-AMD/p/WMD00000421). But it's temporarily out of stock. I had mine with a discount, I think it was $1130 before taxes. \n\nSo far I've changed out the 7200 hard drive for an SSD that I already had on my old computer. The bottom has a bunch of small screws and is a tight fit, but it comes off with access to the RAM and easy to change out the hard drive. \n\nI have this laptop, it's been great so far. The 2060 is the refresh, but for some reason on the 17\" Legion 5 it boosts up to 90W instead of 115W like some of the 15\" versions do.", "Well let me tell you, My last AMD card was a complete disaster, and a POS. Nivida all the way.\n\n...Actually, I did have issue with AMD drivers, on the previous card (That I killed, may it rest in peace) I eventually got them sorted out and it was a nice card until it died. The refurbished replacement I received from MSI, was another story, I couldn't get the HDMI audio to work on windows 7 without disabling driver signature enforcement and even then, it would randomly display a completely green screen.\n\nIn conclusion; Fuck MSI and their warrenty, they sent me a badly refurbished card that had scratches, and chips on the GPU die and they won't get my business again.

Most of the time, he doesn't even know what he's talking about. I would not recommend giving this troll the attention he seeks. \n\nThat said, sony is capable of acquiring a publisher if they truly wanted. With the Xilinx purchase, AMD payed for it in stock. Meaning AMD bought Xilinx with in the form of liquid assets, or their own stock instead of cash. Sony could leverage this if they wanted, they could also mix cash, stock, and even issue bonds or borrow money to fund the purchase. This is a really common way of doing things, nothing new. However if Sony were to use these methods to purchase a publisher, they would go through a very careful risk-reward assessment and they wouldn't do it for clout, it would be a very precise acquisition. \n\nThe only thing this post is relevant to is dreamkillers ego, where he just wants go bash on MS fans and stir up bs. Sony has great studios, playstation will always have great exclusives. There is no reason to hate one console over the other, they both have earned their respect in the gaming industry and will always continue to do so.

But I'll answer assuming AMD numbers are true. \n\nPrice to performance wise: 6900XT, although beats 3090 by a fucking huge margin, it doesn't hold a candle to 3080 or 6800XT, obviously. And 3070 and 6800 are even better choice in my opinion. \n\nFrom pure performance (raster) perspective, 3080 ~= 6800 XT &gt; 6800 &gt; 3070. The AMD lead here will be more if you have latest AMD CPUs, due to smart access memory. (I didn't include 3090 and 6900XT because I am assuming you aren't looking for them). \n\nPower wise, AMD wins, but not by a wide margin tbh. 320W vs 300W will be considerable if it pushes you to buy a higher end power supply, which it may or may not. \n\nRay tracing performance wise: consider this point only if ray tracing is your thing. Although AMD didn't show their ray tracing performance, it's reasonable to assume that it is not comparable to Nvidia's performance. Which makes sense that Nvidia is already at 2nd gen RTX. \n\nDLSS: Again consider only if it's your thing. But i think DLSS has matured enough to consider it seriously. And Nvidia wins here, because AMD doesn't have a good contender for DLSS right now. They have super resolution thing going on, but it won't be available till Atleast 2021. But even with that, I doubt first iteration of super resolution will be good enough, as Nvidia beats Amd in AI by a good margin, reasons include the tensor cores. Plus DLSS is a software solution, so if if dlss gets even better, which I think it will, then you'll be able to use it by downloading drivers. \n\nI think I wrote too much about DLSS lol.

They have the lead in the market, for now at least, and they know if anyone wants the best of the best no matter what, they'll pay anything. And no SLI means you can't slap two 3080s together and get better performance, so you can't outperform the 3090 for a lower price. Yet anyway. We'll see how AMD's claims about the 6900XT nearly matching the 3090 hold up once that's released.

Last time I checked, installing the whole bundle on Sid breaks OpenGL.\n\nSo I made a little dummy package to 1) convince apt that AMD's stupid metapackage is installed and 2) set up the linker path, since they install the driver to /opt/amdgpu-pro/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu. That allowed me to install *only* opencl-orca-amdgpu-pro-icd_[version]_amd64.deb from the official AMDGPU-PRO release for Ubuntu (I have an rx470; for some newer cards you would want opencl-amdgpu-pro-icd_[version]_amd64.deb instead).\n\nFor a few months now, the proprietary OpenCL drivers have been working just fine alongside the open-source \"everything else\" drivers from Debian on my machine.

(idek what sound cards do)\n\nYes, there's a bunch. There's Wifi, Bluetooths, RAID caids... There's even some weird ones out there, like 4G and stuff.\n\n&gt;--What are the functional differences between AMD and Intel CPUs? I'm leaning towards AMD just because I heard it has better cost efficiency and less cooling/power requirements. But do I lose any technical stuff?\n\nFunctionally, for desktop usage, none. They do the exact same thing as far as the final user is seeing, you're not gonna see a software that \"requires X brand to work\". The difference comes down to _how fast_ they do it, at what price/power draw/heat.\n\n&gt;--What are the differences between different brands of the same GPU? They tend to vary in cooling, but to the performances inherently differ disregarding cooling?\n\nInherently, performances do not vary. However, technically, they may vary due to cooling solutions being different. GPUs today use variable clocks, and they can boost those clocks higher and higher if the GPU detects it has thermal/power overhead. 99/100 times GPUs of the same \"core\" will present performance within margin of error of one another regardless of whatever the branding claims it to be, albeit some may be a bitch to cool.\n\n&gt;--What's the difference between different brands of RAM?\n\nThere's really only 3 brands of RAM. Hynix, Samsung and Micron. Every single DDR4 desktop RAM you see being sold had its RAM made by one of those 3 manufacturers. Which doesn't mean they're all the same, Samsung can make a PoS RAM and the next conveyer belt down the line makes a great one.\n\nLong story short, brands matter very little. Right now the Samsung B-die seems to be all the rage, but I wouldn't worry about that unless you want to achieve extraordinarily high frequencies, such as 4000Mhz or whatever. \n\n&gt;Obviously design differences, but can you make up for less frequency with just more RAM?\n\nYou cannot. Ram amount means data stored - temporarily, but stored nonetheless - while ram frequency just means the communication between ram and CPU is running at said frequency.", "No real differences between intel and amd cpus.\n\nAnd yes what you say basically about cpu/gpu/ram is true. But obviously some stuff is calculated by your gpu, as it has a processor as well just as your Central Processing Unit is a processor essentially.\n\nOkay so GPU is made by 2 big companies AMD and Nvidia (similar how cpus made by amd and intel). The differences is that gpus can be produced by other companies, msi, asus, etc. The difference between a 3080 thats made by nvidia (called founders edition) and a one made by ASUS is only the cooling and the asus one might have some default overclocks. Also the founders edition cards are not manufactured as long i believe. So you might not be able to buy a new FE from last year (im not sure about this as in my country nvidia doesnt even sell their FE cards)\n\nNow there are some differences between amd and nvidia gpus, some software stuff or what can the cards do, but generally they do the same thing. (Think about it like cars. Bmw and audi still takes you from A to B, but maybe Audi has seat warmers).\n\nYou cant make up ram frequency with more ram. More ram would just cause you to have a bigger memory, but it wont make it faster.\n\nOh please dont go 4k 60fps.

For about 2700 you can build a pretty good pc. As far as CPus you basically said it. AMD seems to be the better buy especially in what you are planning to do with it.

So in that case you might see small performance changes.", "&gt; if amd gets dlss nvidia is done for lol\n\nI don't know about that.

This data, referred to as session density, is crucial for capacity planning. It wasn\u2019t long before the team got the answer it was looking for.\n\n\u201cWe established an end-to-end feedback loop that allowed us to test the performance and efficiency of different Microsoft 365 apps using AMD EPYC\u2013based virtual machines,\u201d says Soni. \u201cWe discovered we could use the second-generation AMD EPYC processors to achieve parity on reliability and latency\u2014but with added memory and lower costs.\u201d\n\nEven better, Office Collaboration Services could transition to AMD EPYC\u2013based virtual machines seamlessly with Azure Virtual Machines.

By May, it had the new setup up and running.\n\nUpgraded infrastructure, improved performance\n\nToday, Office Collaboration Services uses Azure Virtual Machines to run the majority of its workloads through Eav4 series AMD EPYC\u2013based virtual machines, handling millions of sessions per day\u2014even more than the team expected to support in its initial capacity planning.\n\nOn top of ensuring as many people as possible can deploy Microsoft 365 apps whenever they need them most, the team proved it could deliver all-around better experiences. In terms of latency, the solution generated performance gains of 15 to 20 percent. \u201cWith AMD EPYC\u2013based virtual machines,\u201d says Soni, \u201cwe\u2019ve managed to dramatically lower Microsoft 365 latency.\u201d\n\nAnd in the spirit of continuous improvement, Office Collaboration Services is far from content with what it\u2019s achieved so far.

Even though the 6800XT and 6900XT are both 300W TDP cards, AMD recommends a 850W PSU for a 6900XT, an extra 100W over their 750W recommendation for the 6800XT, which hints at transient power spikes being a thing to watch out for.  I would recommend waiting for benchmarks and power testing if interested in the 6900XT.

That basically means that all required machinery and tooling already exists and is primed, meaning qualcomm and AMD 'just' need to engineer the chipsets, then have them made at whoever has the tech to do so.\n\nIntel needs to buy all their own tools/machinery/factories.\n\nWhy intel won't just find a 3rd party, i don't know.

They are meant to represent frame pacing, which means how consistent the frames are shown. \n\nThey are  meant to catch the average experience. Average FPS will show you a rough metric of how fast the game runs. So lets say you take 1 minute worth of data, and the average of the FPS is 100. That average doesn't take into account dips of FPS, which make the game feel really choppy and stuttery. So the 1% low might show you 20 fps, which means, 1% of that recorded minute, you will play at 20 fps.\n\nThis thing became really relevant when AMD released Ryzen, their processors had way better 1% lows in gaming, while Intel had better average FPS.

That's 100 frames per second. You measure it running for 10 seconds, that averages to 100fps. Beautiful.\n\nNow imagine that the game runs with at almost constant frame time of 9ms but every 91st frame happens to be difficult for the GPU and takes 100ms (1/10th of a second). For 90 frames of 91, the game is now running at 111 frames per second, with the 91th frame added to the mix bringing it down to 100 frames per second. You measure it running for 10 seconds, it averages to 100fps. Same *average fps* as the previous example. But now, every second, the game freezes for 100ms (which is a very noticeable stutter and will feel AWFUL).\n\nThis second case has same average FPS, but the 1% lows will be... well, that depends on how you calculate it but either 10FPS or something a bit higher, a much uglier number but much more important one, because it tells you that *at it's worst,* the run is a 10FPS slideshow, which feels and looks atrocious.\n\nThere's some concern that since AMD's Big Navi relies on a big but limited cache to supplant low VRAM bandwidth, the worst case scenario (a frame being drawn needing a lot of data that isn't in the cache at the moment) could lead to terrible 1% and 0.1% (even less frequent but but possibly ever longer stutters) lows.

The most demanding games are already benefiting from 8 cores. \n* **Cpu cooler:** The Ryzen 7 3700X comes with the [RGB Wraith Prism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXmVQrOmF98) cpu cooler, so there is no need for an after market cooler unless you need a dead silent system unless you want to overclock or you need a dead silent system. Note that overclock Ryzen 3000 series CPUs delivers minimal performance gains and is not worthwhile from a practical standpoint.\n* **Motherboard:** This is one of the two best value mid-range motherboards for Ryzen 3000 series CPUs (the other being the Gigabyte B550 AORUS ELITE.\n* **Memory:** 3600mhz CL16 is the price/performance sweet spot for Ryzen 3000 cpus. 16GB is standard for gaming PCs right now but you will need more than that in a couple of years so I've included 32GB in this build.\n* **SSD:**  Cheapest 2TB NVMe SSD with a 5 year warranty. \n* **Video Card:** [~66%](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-gtx-1080-ti.c2877) stronger than the 1080 Ti. Much cheaper.\n* **Case:** As requested. I added an additional fan for the rear exhaust. \n* **Power Supply:** 10 year warranty. [Tier A](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/1116640-psu-tier-list-40/) recommended for high-end gaming PCs. 850W is more than enough for this 500W PC and leaves plenty of room for future upgrades.

It sells out in just minutes online, so just be prepared to wait a bit for one. For what it's worth, AMD is releasing some GPUs later this month that will compete with the 3080 at a slightly lower cost.", "Yes. If you're mid release cycle of a generation it's always a good idea to wait. Nobody actually knows how the AMD offerings will perform in the real world, and we won't for sure until they're actually out. Worst case scenario they suck and you buy whatever you were gonna buy, best case they're tits and you either get one or get whatever you were going to get at a lower price.", "&gt; Considering that the RX 6800 is meant to compete with and correspond to the RTX 3070 (which is roughly equal to the RTX 2080Ti in performance), if these benchmarks are real, then they indicate that the RX 6800XT and RX 6900XT are proportionally faster than the RTX cards with which they compete and to which they correspond (i.e. the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090, respectively) in Shadow of the Tomb Raider under the aforementioned settings with ray tracing enabled when the RTX cards aren't using DLSS.\n\nThis is faulty logic.

The RT process returns the closest triangle the ray hit, and where in the triangle it hit.\n\nChecking a ray against all triangles is too much work to be practical, so there's an acceleration structure, which divides space into smaller and smaller sections. The idea is that space is mostly empty, so we first find where in space the ray is aiming at, and then test only the triangles there.\n\nFor example of space subdivision, it could go something like this: small boxes encompass a bunch of triangles, then larger boxes encompass a collection of small boxes, and so on. A ray will then be tested against top level boxes, then inside that box against the smaller boxes, and so on until it reaches the triangle level.\n\nSo tracing of a ray will look like: test ray against box, test ray against box, .... test ray against box, test ray against triangle, ... test ray against triangle.\n\nNVIDIA's solution presumably does such a loop and then returns the result. AMD's solution does each step separately.\n\nRDNA 2 has a unit per CU that can do either texturing (bring texture data from RAM, average it in some ways for filtering, then return it to the shader) or a ray tracing intersection (bring RT data from RAM, test a ray against a box or triangle, return the result to a shader).\n\nThis would be used multiple times for a single ray to determine what it hits (if anything).\n\nI hope this makes things clearer.", "From the faq:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;AMD Family  \n&gt;  \n&gt;While it may be more work, the AMD hackintosh scene has gotten quite a  bit easier.

Just because of its close connection with nvidia rtx and how it's expected to be a flagship game to showcase what rtx really can be. AMD is lagging in ray tracing yeah and the capabilities of the 6800xt will not equal that of the 3080 in terms of ray tracing. However, it's up to you to decide whether ray tracing is something you want on or not. Personally, I want the highest frame rate possible with the best graphics settings so I didn't go for a ray tracing gpu. If you want smooth gameplay with great graphics and high resolution and ray tracing isn't important, the 6800xt is the best bet you can make. If you do think ray tracing will make your game look better and it's worth the over 50% performance drop (albeit mitigated by dlss) then go with the 3080.", "Looks like AMD but we won't know until 3rd parties do some in depth testing and we see the cards actually hit the market.\n\nThere's also some open ended questions as to how AMD card perform in ray tracing and if and what their comparable solution is to Nvidia DLSS", "Well Nvidia stock is practically nonexistent rn, and new AMD cards aren't releasing for 2 weeks.  So if you can, wait for that release and benchmarks, then probably buy whichever you can get your hands on first.  \n\nIf AMD's 1st party benchmarks are remotely accurate, then the cards are going to have very similar price/performance.", "Or or or, you don't give your money to a whore of a corporation.\n\nNot like AMD has never done shady stuff, but Intel leaves them far behind.", "I guess that\u2019s an obvious answer so I deserve that lol. Do you think it\u2019s worth it to turn off G-SYNC and go with the AMD card, or keep G-sync on and get an aib 3070?", "If you have gaming in mind the GPU is probally the most important part considering the CPU doesn\u2019t bottleneck it, but if you plan on streaming, editing/recording videos only, you should invest more in the CPU.\n\nBut honestly speaking the 5000 series might be a bit of an overkill depending on how professional your work will be, I mean an pc with an i5-10600k and a GTX 1660 (or its AMD counterparts) should already do the job up to 4K video editing, 1080p streaming, etc. But if you have the extra money or are going to use some heavy professional work investing a little more wouldn\u2019t hurt.\nAlso remember that a lot of RAM and large/fast SSDs are a good help for this kind of work.", "Thanks for the suggestions. The only thing I am worried about is if the motherboards supports the new cpu from AMD.", "I've read posts about AMD's graphic drivers being poor compared to Nvidia's.  Is this true or just brand bias?", "Ah, how the tide has turned.  I always felt people here mostly love AMD for the price and not for all the reasons for superiority being stated back then.  Now that Intel is somehow cheaper, the \"shintel\" posts are disappearing and I see so many posts recommending Intel instead.  There will still be some die-hard fanboys doing mental gymnastics over this, instead of just telling people to buy what fits their requirement and wallet (which is becoming Intel now).", "Wait until late November (November 18th,19th, etc) for when benchmarks of the new amd cards come out. But first question is what resolution do you game at? And what is the refresh rate of your monitor and what games do you play? With that info I usually go find benchmarks of the latest cards say the 3070 and if the games I play are listed they often have last gen there, too, to compare. The thing with the 3xxx series Nvidia cards is DLSS 2.0 is really compelling. The cards can render at less than the stated resolution and then use machine learning to upscale it and you\u2019d be hard pressed to notice the difference. It\u2019s one thing to look for (DLSS off when comparing against AMD cards for a true apples v apples comparison).", "The interesting part is, we now have to see how AMD GPUs fare without SAM across games.  If there is such a high premium to pay to go full AMD (CPU + GPU) for slightly better or equal gaming performance, it may make more sense to do Intel + Nvidia instead.  Benchmarking is going to be complicated this time, lots of combinations possible.", "Plus Intel CPUs don't really need faster RAM like AMD does. Also [Intel is cooler](https://tpucdn.com/review/amd-ryzen-5-3600xt/images/cpu-temperature.png)", "SAM is ok but RT+DLSS is still more desirable IMO, I'm sorry I won't be looking at AMD GPU's until they have an answer to DLSS and prove to be as good at RT as Nvidia. AMD still needs to earn its trust with GPUs for a reliable experience, id give this gen a skip if you are getting the same performance for the same price between the two brands (which looks like the case this time). I think with stronger earnings and overall direction AMD is at, they will get better over time, and consumers win. Nvidia is definitely sweating, and it's good for us (consumers)", "Going purely by AMD launch-speak, SAM is a nice free bump in performance if you are in the latest AMD eco-system.  So there's something in that, if someone doesn't care about the overall higher pricing.\n\nBut yes, I do agree.  If the RT + DLSS equivalent in AMD is also not as good, and you are not on Zen3 so no SAM, then an AMD GPU becomes an even less desirable option.

Go figure! \n\nI really like the value of this whole generation but specifically the 6800XT with it's price win over the 3080 and then the fact that they're using a 7nm HOPEFULLY meaning the stock will be more plentiful to us Canucks... I'm really just hoping the improvements they made to the ray tracing are good and they get better, with some kind of AMD upscale on the horizon.

RT performance of the RX6800 (non-XT) is on the same level of a 2080ti which should be good enough. We have to wait for more info on \"Super Resolution\" (DLSS alternative) and if it is working in any game that supports DLSS.\n\nAMD has a \"counter\" to both features, the next 2 weeks will give us more information about how competitive they are.\n\nI am patiently waiting for news on RT performance and \"Super Resolution\", and if NVIDIA announces a counter to the 16GB VRAM on the AMD cards. \n\nAt first I wanted to buy a 3080 for CP2077, but since it only has 10GB VRAM and is pretty much unavailable I will wait until the release of the new AMD cards. Everyone should do that imo.", "As much as I'm an AMD \"fanboi\", for gaming in a budget (around 15k) and in class of 6 core processors, I agree that intel 10400f is the better choice AT THE MOMENT due to lack of better options (aka stock unavailability/overpriced Ryzen 3600). However if you're looking for long term gaming and 8 core CPUs which will likely be the new standard considering that the ps5 and Xbox series X has already moved on to 8 cores, move on to a 3700x or 5600x. Game developers are obviously going to take this into consideration. Since a game takes a few years of development, a lot of recently released games didn't really take advantage of more than 4 cores due to \"someone\" limiting flagship processors to just 4 cores and 8 threads for the general consumers until 2017 when Ryzen made 6 cores and higher CPUs easily available to the general public at some very reasonable costs. Since then game development has taken a turn and some of the recent titles are in fact using more than 6 cores as well. Now with the consoles themselves turning to 8 cores, pc gaming is highly unlikely to be limited to less than 8 cores in AAA titles in the upcoming years. Also a significant amount of users do other things besides gaming. But I get your point and you did mention for gaming :)", "i feel ya man, i think youll be better served with going for a b550 than x570, theyre both just as future proof annd AMD will probably change socket size in thier next gen aafter zen 3 thus requiringnew mobo, more reason to penny pinch on a mobo, thhus further benefitting going with a 550. aorus pro is solid AF, i think this x570 would be overkill", "That\u2019s a 1440p Ultrawide monitor (3440x1440). If I have to guess, (since the game isn\u2019t out yet) you\u2019ll need at least a 3080 or whatever the AMD equivalent is (6800XT/6900XT?). A 2080 Ti level of performance isn\u2019t going to cut it. Also, although the new AMD GPUs have implemented Ray Tracing, I have no idea how it compares with the nVidia cards.\n\nAs for the CPU, I would plan to get 5800X but I assume you can get away with any 9/10th gen Intel or Zen 2/3 6c/12t cpu.", "Well, if you have a monitor with freesync but no DisplayPort input, you want to stay with AMD just to use that (NVIDIA does support freesync just not without DisplayPort).\n\nThat niche notwithstanding, waiting for RX 6000 seems like a no brainer given your budget, it's not like there's 3000 series piling about in the stores anyway.", "AMD will squeeze out what all profit they can before intel next gen comes, I am sure intel will be back with something that will be worth.\n\nSo for the time being AMD has increase all CPU prices by \\~50 USD, and for us budget gamers that not good, so a intel counter part 10400f is what the best bang for buck, but that limits you to that gen only a investment in ryzen with b450 or b550 motherboard can enable you for future upgrade.", "\"Smart Access Memory\" a feature that allows the new Zen 3 processors to access more VRAM on the new 6xxx GPUs at one go than usual.  As per AMD, this leads to about 5-6% performance increase in games, which is pretty nice.\n\nDetails are still sketchy so far, so we will have to see how it actually works, but it seems it could have been artificially locked by AMD to only the new GPUs and CPUs using a proprietary instruction set.  It seems Linux has had this feature for a while, and in fact the code for that was actually committed by AMD.  Windows supports it too, but there was no implementation so far.\n\nTheoretically, Nvidia could use the same AMD instruction set and enable this for AMD processors for their GPUs, and use a similar Intel instruction-set for enabling on Intel processors.  However, I believe there is some BIOS support necessary for this as well, so implementation by Nvidia looks a bit tough to me even if technically possible on non-AMD platforms at least.", "What\u2019s your power supply? The 2700 is ok, but will bottleneck the 3080, but you will still have extreme gains with performance. You might want to consider AMD Radeon 6800XT over 3080. And further down the line you could upgrade CPU again. But again - make sure your PSU - power supply - is 650w or more", "That matters because Intel provides the same performance with slow RAM compared to AMD with faster RAM. And slower RAM is cheap.", "I think that both are good choices in general. Perhaps the only differentiating factor is the portability, that is obviously worse for the XMG Core because of the size (if you decide to get the 17) and battery. But we are living in corona times, everybody will have to stay home for a long time in the next few years and perhaps having a big screen is a positive point.\n\nThe only thing that I do not like in the XMG Core AMD, is that the webcam is near the hinge, but this happens only in the 15\" version.", "Saying anything not pro-AMD on this sub is not seen very nicely for the most part. I just chalk it down to us being a pauper nation and let it go.", "Do you need it now? Because a new generation is coming out really soon. I know technology is always improving and there will always be something better coming, but AMDs graphic cards seem to be really promising.\n\nThe biggest problem I see is that for rendering the more VRAM your GPU has the better it will perform on big projects, and 6GB is not that much.\n\nI personally don't like EVGA power supplies, there are better for less money, and then you can buy a bigger GPU.\n\nAre you willing to buy used? Maybe you can catch a better CPU used for the same money.", "Nice to see a well laid out 'What I'm looking for/use case', 'budget', and questions.\n\nThings that jump out: \n\nThe cooler is thoroughly underwhelming, I hesitate to suggest it for a quad core. The stock cooler is either just as good or your going to need a lot more cooling than a 212 anyway.\n\nMB, for a $200 B550 MB, you need to be after something. Wireless usually ends up better going $130MB+$40 card, the 2.5G network also jumps out, but if you don't need that, that is budget freed up.\n\nGPU, I know the GPU market is all sorts of messed up, but that's too much for a 2060, you can get more card for less. Also I try to avoid MSI cards where possible, some of the 20 cards had $0.02c too little thermal pads and the thermals where very high. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my understanding, the more professional workloads can come in 1 of 3 flavors: All the CPU, all the GPU, or all the clock. As the last is mostly for physics based simulation, I don't think it applies. These sorts of heavy data crunching builds are somewhat rare here, but I have seen a few come through, I think the last one was working on images for the data set and it was a case of 'so how many Titans/3090s can you shove in the system?' I think we started running into 'need more budget' issues after the second. Without more details, my gut instinct is throw more GPU at the problem. You don't have the budget for a 3090, but even a slightly upclocked 3080 is only going to be a bit more and a lot more data crunching power. For now lets trim the rest of the system and see whats left for a CPU.\n\nGPU/PSU: I don't do ML/data crunching, but I do do 3D art stuff that is heavy on the processing power. I ran the numbers on how fast either upgrading or adding a second GPU will pay for itself. I forget the exact numbers but even a somewhat worse case was 4-6 weeks for a $2500 card, best was 2-3 weeks. Its time not sitting around waiting for stuff to render, being able to run a second job overnight, being able to have a pass finished by the time you run to the refrigerator and grab a sandwich instead of having to wait overnight, etc. So 3080 is basically the same price so is an obvious upgrade if you can find one. With that in mind, how long do your runs take/do you run stuff overnight? Between some wiggle room for the CPU, the 30 cards being a bit heavy on the power draw, and a mostly all up workload, the 850W PSU is less overkill than you think. You might be able to do 750W, but the 860W option was still cheaper. Also more efficient. I can't quite justify titanium at more than double the price unless your running overnight.\n\nRAM looks fine. As for 2x vs 4x, 2x is expandable, its slightly easier to tweak 2x than 4x, and something something AMD memory controller...4x not good? Basically go 2x/4x over 4x/8x. SSD is good, also check Sabrent drives for pricing, they are very similar to Samsung in terms of performance. Case looks good, but you can drop the extra fan.\n\nWith the budget poked and a 3800X as a placeholder for the CPU, the budget is down to just over $1800, no wireless and basic 1Gbit networking. Sticking a hefty cooler in leaves just over $100 for upgrade options. I don't think you need more cores as most is offloaded to the GPU, but faster cores may be nice. 5800X fills the budget and the cooler can handle it easily. Other than that unless there is something you need, just hold onto the last $100.\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/GFprrr)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 7 3800X 3.9 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/qryV3C/amd-ryzen-7-3800x-39-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000025box) | $344.99 @ Amazon \n**CPU Cooler** | [Noctua NH-D14 64.95 CFM CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/46tCmG/noctua-cpu-cooler-nhd14) | $79.95 @ Amazon \n**Motherboard** | [MSI B550-A PRO ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/7gxbt6/msi-b550-a-pro-atx-am4-motherboard-b550-a-pro) | $139.99 @ B&amp;H \n**Memory** | [G.Skill Ripjaws V 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3600 CL16 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/zcH8TW/gskill-ripjaws-v-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-f4-3600c16d-32gvkc) | $147.99 @ Newegg \n**Storage** | [Samsung 970 Evo 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JLdxFT/samsung-970-evo-10tb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-mz-v7e1t0baw) | $149.99 @ Amazon \n**Video Card** | [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 10 GB Founders Edition Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/RnDkcf/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-10-gb-founders-edition-video-card-9001g1332530000) | $800.00 \n**Case** | [Cooler Master MasterCase H500 ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/G766Mp/cooler-master-mastercase-h500-atx-mid-tower-case-mcm-h500-ignn-s00) | $84.99 @ Newegg \n**Power Supply** | [Fractal Design Ion+ 860 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/npGnTW/fractal-design-ion-860-w-80-platinum-certified-fully-modular-at-power-supply-fd-psu-ionp-860p-bk) | $145.98 @ Newegg \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $1913.88\n | Mail-in rebates | -$20.00\n | **Total** | **$1893.88**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2020-11-04 03:39 EST-0500 |", "[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/BkH6f9)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 3.6 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QKJtt6/amd-ryzen-7-3700x-36-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000071box) | $304.99 @ Amazon \n**Motherboard** | [ASRock B550 Phantom Gaming 4 ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4mjNnQ/asrock-b550-phantom-gaming-4-atx-am4-motherboard-b550-phantom-gaming-4) | $99.99 @ Newegg \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **$404.98**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2020-11-04 03:45 EST-0500 |", "AMD is more multi-purpose and cheaper", "Dude,im talking about optimization.\n\nThe AMD Encoder (that uses the GPU) sucks,you can try every setting,but still look crispy and pixelated.", "But a lot more people were able to get Zen 2 than people could get a 30 series card.

I definitely wouldn't advise you to put all your eggs in one basket, but I do believe that AMD is a very good buy in the long-term.\n\nFundamentally, they have an absurdly phenomenal management team. Since Lisa Su's inception, the company has experienced tremendous growth and even managed to steal away Intel's lead architect. Although AMD has always has great products, Lisa Su has really managed to take it to the next level and make AMD nearly a household name at this point with the rise of customized computer building.\n\nI guess to answer your question better, if you're planning on holding this for 10+ years, I have no doubts that this stock will grow especially with its acquisition of Xilinx and incredible product line. These synergies match especially well and I don't see a way that Intel could possibly topple AMD as it previously has. The semiconductor industry has been seeing a growing prevalence, especially with its intertwining of AI (i.e. NVDIA).  \n\n\nEDIT: I know that might be a pretty ambiguous answer, but I've done a few analyses and reports on AMD, so if you have any other questions regarding their financials/future outlook, feel free to reach out!", "No reason why not to wait till then and see?\n\nI think there WILL be a price drop on every Zen 2 GPU, only makes sense since Zen 3 is out.

That means that if Apple would push their cores to the same frequencies as AMD, Zen 3 would be probably more than half the single core performance.\n\nI think people don't understand exactly what Apple's strategy with their chips was.\n\nTo get efficiency, you need low frequencies.

I'll believe the \"above the 5700XT\" performance figures when I see them, not a minute earlier.\n\nAnd also I don't think the merits of PCMR hardware come just from the parts manufacturers or spec numbers, they come from the freedom of usage, software selection and upgradeability lended to this platform.

With the other hardware choices, this board is going to perform just as good as any more expensive model and there are really no features an X570 board has that are going to impact you.

It's a less popular model, but basically identical to the popular Sabrent Rocket (uses the same controller and NAND, same speed).

But for cases you should just choose whatever you like the look of with the features you need.\n\nHope this helps!

Will RTX3080's work well with PCIe 4.0 at PCIe x4 speed?\n\nAll PCIE GPU's cards will walk down from x16 down to x1 as its fully backwards compatible. The issue is the bandwidth available to the GPU as you drop from x16 to x8 to x4...ect it can(often does) affect performance. Its a balancing act and requires some internal testing for your applications to really know.

AMD seems to be making big leaps with each generation, so maybe the second gen ddr5 would be a meaningful upgrade. That's what I am thinking anyway.", "Some suggestions...\n\n* If you are targeting the RTX 3070 as your starting GPU, I suggest going for the Ryzen 5 5600X instead of Ryzen 5 3600.  This will ensure you maximize the performance of your RTX 3070 which is the most expensive component in your build.  Spending now on a Ryzen 5 5600X will save you money on a second CPU upgrade down the line when you upgrade to RTX 4000 series GPU's after 2-3 years.\n* Skip B450 and go with B550 in case you want to take advantage of direct CPU access to your GPU VRAM like Radeon Smart Access Memory.  Nvidia is also developing the [same technology](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-amd-smart-access-memory-tech-ampere) for RTX 3000 series GPU's and I believe will need PCIe 4.0 to maximize the bandwidth between CPU and GPU.\n* If you decide to go with the Ryzen 5 5600X and B550 motherboard, go with DDR4-3600 memory.  The price is not that more expensive than DDR4-3200 memory and will add an extra boost to CPU performance for little money spent.\n* Skip the Bykski AIO water cooler and put all that money on your CPU.  You are not making the most of your budget by spending on overkill CPU cooling.  What you need is a much faster CPU like Ryzen 5 5600X or better.   You can always add the AIO water cooler later when you want to experiment with overclocking.\n* If possible go with a 500GB SSD if you can.  Starting with a 250GB SSD is fine but trust me it will be at full capacity in less than a year unless you install all your games on the hard drive.  What I suggest is buy a 1TB SSD from the beginning and skip the HDD for the meantime.  Then buy the HDD after a few months when you have more funds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Planning to use StoreMi for tiering my SSD and HDD \n\nAMD [dropped support](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-axes-storemi-technology-replacement-q2-2020) for StoreMi last April and is considered end-of-life.  The replacement has not yet been announced yet if I'm not mistaken.  If you want to use StoreMi today you need to buy the licensed software from Enmotus which is a bit expensive.  Rather than pay for the license, just buy a bigger SSD instead.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of SDD caching between SSD and HDD, the most effective implementation I have seen so far is Intel's Optane memory.  My friend uses Intel Optane 32GB to cache a 4TB game drive (HDD) and it works very well and feels as fast as an SSD.  The problem though is Intel Optane is expensive and uses up a valuable M.2 slot on your motherboard.

In fact, it is more common for a retailer to charge more, than less, especially in areas where online shopping or importing is difficult.\n\nSometimes, the manufacturer sets the MSRP fairly high, as seen in, for example, genuine LEGO sets.

The LICENSE is 30 to 60 Bucks.\n\nSmall stores often, and with ease, give 10% off MSRP, and still make a good bit of money, especially on good sets that pretty much fly off the shelves. Stuff that clings to shelves still can get sold for 20% off, with ease, but it might get a bit close, especially with small sets that don't cost much to begin with.\n\nAnd if stuff simply doesn't move, but a retailer has to stock it for contract reasons, they have to go for -30% or more, making a loss.", "You get the MSRP if you buy it in AMD store.

There are ALWAYS going to be new cards coming within 6-12 months. That's just how this industry works. nVidia will release a 3080ti or super variants of their current cards that offer better performance for the same/less money. AMD will have their new offerings as well, and may even have more coming if the response from nVidia is strong enough.\n\nBut at a certain point if a card is available that meets your performance needs and budget, you should just go for it and don't look back. I was thinking of holding onto my GTX 1080 for another six months until nVidia/AMD had released all of their product stack. But then Best Buy stocked the 3080 FE at $699, which was within my budget, and the card is more than twice as fast as what I have right now, which is the performance uplift I usual target when upgrading.

See row 12, pg. 18 [here](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/SocketAM4/ROG_STRIX_X570-E_GAMING/Memory_QVL_for_AMD_Ryzen_5000_Series_Processors_X570.pdf). I think you've definitely got the sweet spot for speed (3600C16).\n   * Minor thing, but Gamers Nexus did a test with the new Ryzen chips and how they perform with 2 sticks vs. 4 sticks. There was a fairly decent performance increase when using 4 instead of 2 (contrary to the 3000 series, oddly). Just something to consider if you choose to go with 2 - i.e. if you upgrade with another 2 later, should seem some bonus gains.\n* I don't know the case well, but just make sure your motherboard has all the required connects for the case I/O (e.g. if case has USB-C Gen 2 on the front, your motherboard has that connection as well).", "Or the 17inch https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-5-series/Legion-5-17-AMD/p/WMD00000421", "[PCPartPicker Part List](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/list/Dwkwgt)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/g94BD3/amd-ryzen-5-5600x-37-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100000065box) | $469.00 @ BPC Technology \n**Motherboard** | [MSI B550-A PRO ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/7gxbt6/msi-b550-a-pro-atx-am4-motherboard-b550-a-pro) | $209.00 @ JW Computers \n**Memory** | [OLOy 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3600 CL18 Memory](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/KV4BD3/oloy-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-md4u1636181chkda) | $179.30 @ Newegg Australia \n**Storage** | [Samsung 970 Evo 500 GB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/P4ZFf7/samsung-970-evo-500gb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-mz-v7e500bw) | $96.00 @ Centre Com \n**Storage** | [Seagate Barracuda Compute 2 TB 3.5\" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/mwrYcf/seagate-barracuda-computer-2-tb-35-7200rpm-internal-hard-drive-st2000dm008) | $88.00 @ Umart \n**Case** | [Cooler Master MasterBox TD500 ATX Mid Tower Case](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/v622FT/cooler-master-masterbox-td500-atx-mid-tower-case-mcb-d500d-kann-s00) | $125.00 @ Skycomp Technology \n**Power Supply** | [Cooler Master MWE Bronze V2 750 W 80+ Bronze Certified ATX Power Supply](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/Qn9tt6/cooler-master-mwe-bronze-v2-750-w-80-bronze-certified-atx-power-supply-mpe-7501-acaab-us) | $99.00 @ Mwave Australia \n**Monitor** | [ViewSonic VX2758-2KP-MHD 27.0\" 2560x1440 144 Hz Monitor](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/DjH8TW/viewsonic-vx2758-2kp-mhd-270-2560x1440-144-hz-monitor-vx2758-2kp-mhd) | $459.00 @ PLE Computers \n**Keyboard** | [G.Skill KM360 Wired Standard Keyboard](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/YV6qqs/gskill-km360-wired-standard-keyboard-gk-w0wc4-km360-h10na) | $82.50 @ Newegg Australia \n**Mouse** | [Logitech G603 Wireless Optical Mouse](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/HgdFf7/logitech-g603-wireless-optical-mouse-910-005099) | $82.50 @ Newegg Australia \n**Headphones** | [Sennheiser HD 559  Headphones](https://au.pcpartpicker.com/product/jKM323/sennheiser-hd-559-headphones-hd-559) | $129.66 @ Amazon Australia \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **$2018.96**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2020-11-14 20:41 AEDT+1100 |\n\n\nNo Care has been given to aesthetics unless it was also the best price to performance part I found.\n\nGraphics card: aim for 3070 or what is most likely going to be better for you, the 6800 / 6800xt so that you can use SAM", "Which AMD chip do you consider as alternatives to the 10100F and 10400F ?

I really don't need anything better until Star Citizen comes out, and both AMD and Nvidia are so fucking greedy on pricing I'm just going to buy used when the time comes anyway.", "The 6800 series from AMD are set to be released on the 17th or 18th of this month, it might be something to consider as they\u2019ve said that pairing this GPU with the new 5000 series CPUs is meant to give a small boost to performance, somewhere along 5-10%?. You\u2019d have to look into that yourself, the rx 6800 is competitive with the 3070 in terms of performance and price though!", "A Ryzen 5 3600 will work with RTX 3080 no question. \n\nBut you will not get the most performance out of the RTX 3080 even at 1440p.  You will have a performance loss of around 15% - 20% (more or less) on CPU heavy games by pairing it with a slower Ryzen 5 3600.\n\nIf you are playing at 4K then the Ryzen 5 3600 is fine.  But if you are playing at 1080p or 1440p you are leaving a lot of extra performance on the table.  It would be like buying an RTX 3080 and only getting RTX 3070 performance.\n\nThe price difference between a Ryzen 5 3600 and a Ryzen 5 5600X is around Php 6K.  The price difference between an RTX 3070 and RTX 3080 is around Php 12K.  Wouldn't it make more sense to spend more on the CPU so your build is balanced and minimize any bottlenecks?\n\nKeep in mind the OP is starting with an RTX 3070 on his build.  The next GPU upgrade will most likely be an RTX 4070.  Do you think the Ryzen 5 3600 has enough CPU performance to not bottleneck an RTX 4070 in the future?\n\n----------\n\"Buying 5600x is not about \"maxing out\" the potential, it's more about buying the newest gen out there\"\n\nI absolutely disagree with that statement.  You are buying  the Ryzen 5 5600X because you need or you want it's higher performance for your build.  You are not buying it because it's new tech.\n\nIf AMD comes out with a brand new CPU using the latest technology and architecture... but it performs THE SAME as your old CPU... will you still buy it? :-)", "what did he need it  for? Not really gaming hardware.... I know a lot of early threadripper setups got insane support from AMD for professional projects so seems odd but oh well.", "With both AMD and Intel the first number is the generation. The number after it is the product's place in the hierarchy usually differentiated by core count. Ryzen 1200 was 4 core/4 thread cpu, Ryzen 1400 - 4/8, Ryzen 1600 - 6/12, Ryzen 1700 and 1800 - 8/16. All from the first generation of Ryzen. So 2600 for example is newer than the 1600 (2&gt;1 and obviously better as it's in the same class - 600.) and and has the same amount of cores (6) but faster because of the new architecture. 3600 is newer than 2600, and 5600 is newer than 3600.\n\nWhen it has a G at the end of the naming, it means it has integrated graphics. That's why 3200G and 3400G are more expensive than other options that are better than them, those will need a GPU. Like the 3100 for example. \n\nAnd they really made some mess with product names because of different release dates. 3200G and 3400G are actually second generation but their names begins with 3- because their release date was closer to that of the third generation. Then later 3100 and 3300X were introduced, they are actual third generation cpus and are both faster than the 3400G but they couldn't name them anything else as after the 3400G there already were 3500 and 3600.\n\nIt's actually the same with GPUs. With Nvidia 960, 1060, 2060 are the mid range (-60) graphics across different generations. And 970, 1070 and 2070 are higher end cards from those 3 generations. Same with AMD, although they change naming a little bit more frequently with graphics. Currently 5500XT, 5600XT, 5700XT are the same generation and in order of speed. The recently announced 6800, 6800XT and 6900XT are a new generation, and again, in order of speed.\n\nThis should usually give you an idea of where a product stands but then of course you'd look up an actual comparison for the different choices in your price range.

It is unlikely with the early cards and will be more likely as the manufacturing matures.  The 6800 would be pushing it's maximum potential and will be running much harder than the 6800XT.

AMD is smart to take advantage of the gap between $500 GPUs and $700 GPUs.  It is easy to justify spending $80 more.  $100 is a more intimating number so they came in under that while being over $100 less than a 3080.

Every monitor you see out there nowadays works with AMD FreeSync even if not specified (and same for AMD FreeSync monitor certified but not G-Sync), it's not specified because they didn't certificate it but it most likely works perfectly and in most of the cases, even better than certified ones (google your monitor and see if someone has tried it with FreeSync), if it is indeed G-Sync and not just compatible or certified, then I guess you're tied to 3080 which definitely is not a bad option at all.\n\n&gt;I'll keep the BeQuiet in mind, i really like their white case aesthatics.\n\nI got that one too and I am currently switching forth and back on the cooler, I don't know if I should go for Arctic 360mm for the VRM fan addition or go with Be Quiet! 360MM Pure Loop without VRM fan but with refillable tank which means that after the water evaporates, I will not have to throw it out of the window.

IMO, total transistor count and final performance is the only thing that matters; it is up to the architecture to spend the transistor budget as efficiently as possillble. Navi on a 386bit bus would have used much more power.\n-The comparison with Ampere is somewhat AMD favored; Ampere has much worse perf/transistor than Turing. IMO, TU102 is the true benchmark architecturally. Ampere is very compute heavy.\n\nAll in all, RDNA2 a huge leap over RDNA1. Ampere is a downgrade architecturally over Turing for pure rasterization efficiency. Ampere and RDNA2 are then damn close in terms of rasterization efficiency architecturally. Its a shame for AMD that gaming is much more than rasterization nowadays.", "Frankly, this shouldn't be an unpopular opinion.

I think that the L3 helps a lot for the lower resolutions, but it can only do so much for the higher res. like 4K. They have been looking at semi-unified L1 cache to make them more effective for speeding certain work loads  - filed patent earlier this year.  They have done some work in RDNA1 to reduce need of VRAM access for reducing power, latency and bandwidth.\n\nL3 caches cannot tuned by microcode - programmable parameters may be.

They have a smaller chip using cheaper, more abundant memory modules while also having performance parity with Nvidia's best, excluding RT. The performance parity allows AMD to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Nvidia and ask for the same premium their cards command. Why shouldn't they?\n\nYou've touched on the point yourself, Nvidia are using Samsung's 8nm process. The libraries for 7nm processes are not the same so even when Nvidia do make the jump there is no sure thing that their die size will be small enough or run cool enough to maintain price/performance parity with AMD, plus they're using more expensive and power hungry memory. All of these factors combined mean this is AMD's payday. \n\n&gt;Is a deficit of 5.26 billion transistors in service of offering AIBs a lower BOM justifiable with the tradeoffs made?\n\nIt was a conscious tradeoff by AMD. Could they reach the performance needed to keep all the compute units fed by allocating more die space to cache than buying faster RAM modules? The answer is a resounding yes. \n\nIf in 12 months time AMD want to offer a new generation with GDDR6X, there's no sign Nvidia have an answer to that.\n\n&gt;There may be driver improvements in the pipeline for performance, including for Ray Tracing workloads\n\nFine Wine isn't a meme for nothing :)", "AMD is loosing the software battle by not even bothering to turn up.

If it's true for other games and it's not a bug it would remind the good old tricks of decreasing quality for performance from the 2000s. That would be a very sketchy move from AMD.  \n\n\nOn the other hand there are some games, like Minecraft, in which RTRT puts RDNA2 in a completely different (unplayable) league compared to both Turing and Ampere: in cases like this, there could be some \"nvidia magic\" going on. And by \"nvidia magic\" I mean the kind of magic seen in the extreme tessellation overuse or  \u00a9 Gimpworks  in general.  \n\n\nBoth cases are very good examples of the way the GPU space could become littered by huge differences between vendors, in a similar manner when proprietary APIs were a thing back in the '90s", "I think he only mentioned the 3080Ti to show that Ti models with little bit better specs and bit higher price few months after release of a new generation is Nvidia daily business for some generations now.\n\nThe performance gap between 3070 vs 3080 is fairly big and Nvidia will most likely also want to have an answer for the 16GB VRAM on the new AMD cards. \n\nI think a 3070Ti makes even more sense than a 3080Ti. The rasterizing and RT performance on the 3080 is already good enough. I expect the VRAM amount being a bigger bottleneck. They market the 3080 as a 4K card, so you need enough VRAM for upcoming games in the next 3+ years and 10GB is already saturated by a few present titles in 4K.\n\nOf course you can go down with settings, resolution, ... but wouldn't it be sad having more than enough raw GPU power (reserves) but not being able to use them cause of VRAM limitation? It's like having a supersports car engine in a vehicle with a transmission that can't handle the power. You have to \"balance\" all your components in a way that not one part cripples the whole performance.\n\nIn relation to raw GPU performance I think Nvidia should have gone from the get-go with this:\n\n\\- 3080 = 16GB  \n\\- 3070 = 12GB  \n\\- 3060 = 8GB\n\nI hope we will get a 3070Ti with at least 12GB (although I don't know if that's possible with 256-bit interface or they would need a new PCB layout) and a little bit more cores to reach 6800 performance for $599 MSRP. I don't know if it would make sense to beef up the 3080. A model with just more VRAM and price of $749 would be more than enough to compete with 6800 XT.\n\nPerformance is already about the same, so eliminating the VRAM bottleneck while having lots better RT peformance and DLSS feature, better driver/software support, better hardware encoder, ... will be enough reasons for people to stick to Nvidia and paying a little bit more compared to 6800 XT."], "2020-11-20": ["AMD moves in cycles, it always peaks at around 85 and then falls to 77.

For those unfamiliar with the history of 64bit architecture of x86-64 suffice to say it's a big fucking hack and really inefficient in it's usage of single byte instructions and has other idiosyncrasies that result in the processors needing massive \"frontends\" as we call them which convert instructions into microcode which is what the processor actually executes.\nAArch64 is -not- an extension of the original ARM ISA but rather a completely new one which is more modern and makes best use of the single byte instruction space (single byte in instructions are preferably both for binary size and for optimising frontend for most common cases).\n\nSo future is bright but I wouldn't underestimate just how fucking hard it is to get this stuff right.

I think there big selling point will be its ease of implementation and a push to make it more widespread compared to DLSS. DLSS's main weakness is that it just not implemented enough. And if AMD and MS can somehow bring this to consoles than it has a very high chance to be in a lot of AAA games going forward.\n\n&gt; \"X doubt. I mean sure, drivers and optimization will improve it a bit but I doubt it will improve enough to really matter\"\n\nI will reserve my judgement for AMD's raytracing for now.

The game barely just started. Neither Nvidia nor AMD are going away, so the fight will go on for a while.\n\nIn my opinion, the holy grail here will be when super-sampling can improve quality -without- decreasing performance, or improving performance *without* decreasing speed. \n\nBoth of which are proven to be possible. It is only a matter of time. AMD has the advantage of having consoles on their side. Which needs Super-sampling even more than PCs. Nvidia has the advantage of having a sound head start with investment already starting to payback. We will just have to see how well they go on.", "Also mentioned in the article - bringing SAM to non 500 chipsets. Hopefully AMD comes through on that.", "Right now maybe, but ML-based supersampling is clearly the future.

Things often just felt off/looked wrong/performed wrong/lots of black screen flickering etc.\n\nAnyway, these are the best graphics options I've figured out so far. People can feel free to correct me if they can be bothered to read it. I understand you have a 6800 so a few options might be different, but your fix regarding the AMD overlay certainly brings back memories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gaming &gt; Global Graphics:**\n\n(I'm assuming these are basically the default applied graphics if you don't set up a profile for a specific game, though I'm never 100% because certain features like boost only exist in here). Either way it means most the options are automatically applied to a game profile, apart from the few differences.\n\n1. Graphics profile: Custom\n2. Radeon Anti-lag: Disabled\n3. Radeon Chill: Disabled but I just use RvaTuner to cap my FPS. Might start playing round with Chill, maybe a combo with RivaTuner.\n4. Radeon Boost: Disabled. Again, may be worth a look.\n5. Radeon Image Sharpening: Disabled\n6. Radeon Enhanced Sync: Disabled (can't be used in combination with Vsync btw) \n7. Wait For Verticle Refresh/Vsync: On, unless games specify otherwise or it causes problems. I have it disabled in Windows 10 Graphics settings.\n8. Anti-Aliasing: Use application settings\n9. Anti-Aliasing Method: Multisampling\n10. Morphological Anti-Aliasing: Disabled\n11. Anisotropic Filtering: Disabled\n12. Texture Filtering Quality: High (the software recommends standard but high seems fine to me) \n13. Surface Format Optimisation: Disabled\n14. Tessellation Mode: Use application settings.\n15. OpenGL Triple buffering: Disabled\n16. 10-Bit Pixel Format: Disabled (don't think my monitor supports this)\n17. Reset Shader Cache: I did this once, after DDU\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gaming &gt; Add A Game &gt; Whatever Game (profile):**\n\nMy settings for, say, the witcher 3 and pretty much all other games are:\n\n1. Graphics profile: Custom\n2. Radeon Anti-lag: Disabled\n3. Radeon Chill: Disabled\n4. Radeon Image Sharpening: Disabled\n5. Radeon Enhanced Sync: Disabled\n6. Wait For verticle Refresh/Vsync: On, unless application specifies.\n7. Anti-Aliasing: Use application settings\n8. Anti-Aliasing Method: Multisampling\n9. Morphological Anti-Aliasing: Disabled\n10. Anisotropic Filtering: Disabled\n11. Texture Filtering Quality: High (the software recommends standard but it seems okay to me on high) \n12. Surface Format Optimisation: Disabled\n13. Tessellation Mode: Override application settings (otherwise my feet fell through the ground in The Witcher).\n14. Maximum Tessellation Level 4x\n15. OpenGL Triple buffering: Disabled\n\n**Then on the right:**\n\n1. AMD Freesync: AMD Optimised\n2. Scaling Mode: Global setting Default\n3. Integer Scaling: Disabled.\n4. Custom Colour: Disabled\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Under Display &gt; Global Display Options I have:**\n\n1. AMD Freesync: Enabled\n2. Virtual Super Resolution: Disabled\n3. GPU Scaling: Disabled\n4. Scaling Mode: Preserve Aspect Ratio\n5. Integer Scaling: Not supported.\n6. Colour Depth: 8bpc\n7. Pixel Format: RGB 4:4:4 Pixel Format PC Standard (Full RGB)\n\n**On the right hand side of Global Display Options:**\n\n1. Custom Colour: Disabled\n2. Custom Resolutions: No New Resolutions Set\n\n\\^ I'm pretty sure that I could use one of these settings to downsample my Dragon Age Origins like I could on my 1070 to downsample from 3840x2160 (iirc getting around 144Hz or so, but my attempts so far have been absolutely fruitless with terrible FPS/performance compared to the 1070). Then we have, just below:\n\n**Overrides**:\n\n1. These help with my intermittent black screen flickering. I have them at the following, but have used different settings in the past. Get ready to press escape multiple times in complete panic if they're incompatible and the screen goes black! If you don't get black screen flickering you may not need them, but maybe they'll do the trick. Also only increase one at a time. And maybe research first. Anyway:\n2. Voltage Swing: 1 (out of 2)\n3. PreEmphasis: 2 (out of 2)\n4. HDCP Support: Disabled\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of the many other things I did - and apologies about the length - But I pretty fast realised that I was also documenting this for future reference for myself as it was just so fucking frustrating.", "**Other stuff:**\n\n1. I edited my power plan (high performance) and changed 'link state management' under PCI-Express to off.\n2. I have Freesync enabled on my monitor and ensured my monitor refresh rate was actually set to 144Hz in every possible place on the pc.\n3. I have tried pretty much every driver since May, only using DDU the first time. But many use DDU every time.\n4. My 3700x/b450 power plans were missing and I couldn't uninstall my chipset drivers, or install new ones over the top. So I downloaded - on recommend of AMD - MicrosoftProgram\\_Install\\_and\\_Uninstall.meta.diagcab. Then reinstalled the exact same version drivers and this really improved performance in games, weirdly.\n5. My PCIE connectors aren't daisy chained, they are seperate.\n6. I used a VESA certified Display Port 1.4 cable, not the shitty one that came with the box. I also made sure it was plugged into the port all the way, and not blocked by a PCIE bracket or something.\n7. I disabled Windows FastStartup. Doing so makes Windows reload your GPU drivers every time you boot. You can get batch/reg files from Majorgeeks which do it for you, &amp; I also made sure the group policy was set correctly. Then you also need to make sure your power off/shut down buttons are actually doing what they say and not just hibernating for this to work. I also turned off sleep, and lock at the login screen.

Something really creepy about this is that I realised my computer was switching on - and you wouldn't know at all if not for event viewer entries of driver updates - at about 3am in the morning. You wouldn't know it was switched on even if you were a few foot away trying to sleep. It does this through hibernation of sleep mode, I can't remember which, and installs drivers - usually the wrong ones. OO Shut up Windows 10 software can disable this. Disable Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and also automatic driver updates.\n9. Disable ULPS - ultra low power state: Open regedit as admin, back up regedit, then search for EnableULPS, and set any 1 values to 0 - \n10.

But here  is the kicker, that only happens because the Zen3 cores are clocked at 5  GHz. Firestorm cores are clocked at 3.2 GHz. The Zen3 is just barely  squeezing past Firestorm despite having almost 60% higher clock  frequency.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So  why doesn\u2019t Apple increase the clock frequency too? Because higher  clock frequency makes the chips hotter. That is one of Apple\u2019s key  selling points. Their computers unlike Intel and AMD offerings barely  need cooling.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In  essence one could say Firestorm cores really are superior to Zen3  cores. Zen3 only manages to stay in the game by drawing a lot more  current and getting a lot hotter. Something Apple simply chooses not to  do. \n\n15W Zen 2 4800U trades blows with M1. \n\n[https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/5](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16252/mac-mini-apple-m1-tested/5)\n\nDepends on which specific application you run but average performance is about the same (integer workloads makes Zen win, floating point makes Apple win). Which makes sense really - both are sub 10nm processors and both boast 8 cores. Intel is indeed losing due to having half the cores.\n\nI do wonder where did whoever wrote this article source a mobile Zen3 CPU however as these don't exist yet. So in the moment of brilliance that cannot be understood by a mere mortal they probably compared a desktop CPU (which is binned differently) to a mobile CPU and came to a conclusion that \"hey, AMD is only winning because they have clockspeeds and they can't have such clockspeeds on mobile\" (except for when they do, 15W 4700U boosts up to 4.1 GHz...). This is not linear, you can sometimes halve the power draw and lose like 10% performance. \n\nNot to mention that it's not this simple to \"up the frequency\" either. There is an optimal performance/efficiency point and going past that point quickly gives you negligible performance gains at 50-100%+ power draw. Nobody has attempted to overclock an M1 yet so we don't actually know if it CAN achieve higher clockspeeds. \n\nFor reference - early samples of Zen 1 were capable of hitting max 3.1-3.2 GHz. Released ones aimed at 60-100W could maintain 3.6 Ghz (1800X). Power draw was decent at these clockspeeds. But even if you overvolted the shit out of it and tripled your power consumption you wouldn't really break 4.4 GHz barrier whereas Intel was capable of doing 5 GHz.\n\nSimilarly, older folks might remember Pentium 3 and 4. 4 could achieve much higher clockspeeds (and indeed even today's CPUs don't go as high) because they were designed to hit such clockspeeds.\n\nSo yea, I am kinda annoyed by this kind of pseudo-journalism without real data to back it up. A lot of talk about instruction sets and tight integration of components but no numbers to back it up. Except it's called computer **science** for a reason. \n\nI am not saying Apple did a bad job by any means. M1 is a fairly impressive piece of tech. But if you want to compare it and say how it beats X or Y then actually show tests of X and Y in similar situations rather than theorycraft based on your imagination as it's not backed up by numbers.\n\nIn fact, here are more numbers and in some tests Intel based Mini beats M1 based Mini (eg. CPU encoding at H.265, 26:37 for Intel Mac Mini and 33:49 for M1 Mac Mini. For reference, Ryzen 5600X needed 16 minutes):\n\n[https://youtu.be/4MkrEMjPk24?t=615](https://youtu.be/4MkrEMjPk24?t=615)", "Lenovo Legion 5.

This article has none of them. That is my primary point - technical details and whatnot sure reads nice but if you can't benchmark them they might as well not exist. And for an article that has a title \" Why is Apple\u2019s M1 Chip So Fast?\" I would certainly expect it to ACTUALLY contain performance benchmarks and comparisons to competing products. Especially when you make statements that are proven bullshit like:\n\n\"As far as I remember from performance benchmarks the newest AMD CPU  cores, the ones called Zen3 **are slightly faster** than Firestorm cores. But here is the kicker, that only happens because the Zen3 cores are  clocked at 5 GHz. Firestorm cores are clocked at 3.2 GHz. The Zen3 is  just barely squeezing past Firestorm despite having almost 60% higher  clock frequency. \"\n\nRyzen 5 5600X outperforms M1 by 100% in some of the tests I linked above. It also boosts to up to 4.6 GHz (under single core load) and under full load you will probably see it reach 3.8-3.9 GHz. That's not \"barely\" squeezing past Firestorm. It's \"destroying\" Firestorm. Of course it mostly destroys it as 10W chip really is not going to compete against 65W but get your number straight before writing an article. Especially if you then follow up with \"AMD only barely wins because they eat more power' - which is debunked by 4800U going toe to toe vs M1 in many tests (because surprise, surprise, performance doesn't drop 4x when you decrease TDP 4x, it's more like 30% performance drop). \n\nAgain, I am not saying Apple CPU is bad. I am saying that you are not supposed to give retarded statements like \"**As far as I remember x is slightly better than y(...)**\". Either get that CPU and compare the two yourself or give a proper source you have used to determine that performance. Don't assume.

The AMD LED Header is for ARGB led components. If you had a cooler or fans with ARGB lighting that's how you could control the LEDs from the motherboard.\n\nAlso if there is a dust filter on the top of the case remove it before you install your fans in exhaust mode.

Remove the filters, add two fans, and set the BIOS PWM fan settings so they're not always in a low-speed state. Noctua is quiet to begin with, so let it have some slight fan noise by making it spin at 40-60% speed and increase with heat. Playing with fan curves won't break anything.\n\nYou should also look into changing the fan curve on the GPU (not sure if Sapphire or AMD have this in the software, or you need MSI Afterburner) to kick on the fans at a lower temps.

Manufactured with 2019 technology. \n   * Ryzen 4000G / 3000 (non-G)- close to Intel for gaming, better than Intel for everything else. Nearly as good as 5000 for Photoshop, Premiere, etc. Basically top of the line, except for gaming. 2019 technology. \n  * Ryzen 3000**G** / 2000 (non-G) - budget option, ok, made with 2015 technology.\n\n* Apple:\n   * Apple's new M1 is made with 2021 technology basically. It's super energy efficient, it's better then Intel, but not as powerful as AMD's 4000G/3000 CPUs. It is more energy efficient than AMD. As a totally new type of product, you should expect it to have some glitches and this may cause freezing or other issues. These glitches should be hammered out quickly by Adobe. \n\n* Intel:\n   * 10G and 11G - for example i5-**10**65**G**7 - 2017 technology. Great for small PCs - tablets, thin laptops, MacBooks, Surface, etc. These produce less heat, take less power, and have reasonable performance. Overall it's a solid choice\n* Everything else is 2014 or older technology and runs hot. This includes most Intel CPUs. \n\nGPU:\n\n* AMD:\n   * Radeon: made for gaming, not great for Creative Suite. \n   * Radeon PRO: slightly better for Creative Suite\n\n* Nvidia:\n   * GeForce: 1050 and better models are great for nearly everything. Nvidia worked closely with Adobe, and even created special drivers called \"Nvidia Studio Drivers\" that boost performance with Creative Suite. Newer releases of the studio drivers add support for more and more programs. \n   * MX - better than Intel, competitive with AMD in CS, AMD is better in gaming. \n   * Quadro - Nvidia Studio is just as good, but Quadro is a very expensive and premium alternative. Quadro is ideal for Architecture, Engineering, and 3D design. \n\n* Intel:\n   * Xe - not terrible\n   * Everything else is terrible. 2-3 years back Intel admitted that it was terrible, and they even included AMD GPUs with their high end laptop products. Apple used to be exclusive to Intel, but Apple continued using AMD GPUs because Intel's was terrible. \n\n* Everything else:\n   * RAM - 32 GB is ideal for 1080P video editing. 16GB is acceptable. \n   * SSD - NVMe / PCIe is ideal. No SSD results in a slow PC. \n   * WiFi - Intel is actually king here. WiFi 6 (AX) is the best, and the Intel AX200 is the only WiFi 6 card. WiFi 5 (AC) is still decent.  \n\nRecommendations:\n\nFor a budget laptop, I would recommend the Asus TUF A15, it has everything except WiFi 6, and is the best equipped laptop under $1,000.

They are very expensive, but well made. These typically have the 10G / 11G Intel CPUs which are decent. You have to pay for a lot options, so these are great at the $1,500+ range, but still have interior performance. You pay for a really nice screen, metal construction, thin laptop, etc. \n\nHP has some new Envy laptops worth looking at. They're starting to include 4000G CPUs. \n\nLenovo thinkpads are well made industrial laptops. Look for some with Intel 10G/11G and Nvidia graphics. If they have 4000G models, these would be great. \n\nSurface - premium product, great construction. They mostly use Intel 10G/11G CPUs. AMD 3000G options are not as good, but 4000G is excellent.", "I bought 5600XT this summer, it was good experience until suddenly one month after, it suddenly died.

Once you start digging into it, you find out a few things.\n\nThe AMD CPUs that perform spectacularly all have ludicrous power consumption (200W+), which locks you out of a lot of system form factors, or into watercooling-only designs.  Once you get into the realm of CPUs that fit more or less anywhere (reasonably, this is going to be the 155W models), the performance difference against Intel diminishes significantly.\n\nIf I could summarise your statement as \"at a given wattage and performance AMD will have the advantage on price\" and/or \"at a given price AMD will have the advantage on performance\" then yes, but it's not a universal truth.\n\nIf raw performance is your goal, you also have to be VERY careful which AMD CPUs you buy.  For the Epyc 7xx2 CPUs, the way the CPUs are laid out internally (you can confirm this with `lstopo` on any Linux-running AMD machines you have), the 16MiB L3 cache blocks can be divided between 1, 2, 3, or 4 cores.  The models with fewer cores per cache VASTLY out-perform the ones with more.\n\nWe run a large farm of Dell C series machines.  In the C6525 blade that fits in those chassis you're limited to 155W, the four CPUs in that bracket are:\n\n* 7262: 8C 3.2GHz\n* 7302: 16C 3GHz\n* 7352: 24C 2.4GHz\n* 7452: 32C 2.35GHz\n\nAll four of these models have 128MiB of L3, and since every Epyc CPU has that divided into 16MiB chunks, you can see immediately that they're going to be 16MiB per 1 core (7262) to 4 cores (7452), in order.\n\nIn real-world terms, if you were to multiply cores and clock (as you would note VMWare does right their in the VCenter console), the 7302 (48GHz) ought to be thoroughly trounced by the 7452 (75.2GHz), but in fact the 7302 is a full 50% FASTER for the workloads we're running on it.\n\nOn the Intel side, the performance is (within the margin of error) 100% linear on cores\u00d7clock, at least within a single series (for the current Cascade lake models, the entire \"Gold\" 62xx range, for instance).\n\nThere's a handy table of the relevant attributes of the AMD CPUs here on WikiChip: https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/epyc#7002_Series_.28Zen_2.29, which I've conveniently coloured by the relevant performance-affecting attributes (and added the L3 cache division) here: https://i.imgur.com/lpWkEKu.png\n\nNow saying all of this, if you really want to party then the ones you really want are the 7F52 (16C 3.5GHz 16MiB L3 per core) and 7F72 (24C 3.2GHz 16MiB L3 per 2 cores).  They're some of the most expensive CPUs in the entire range, and at 240W you're going to have a fun time with any large deployment, but the performance absolutely cannot be beaten.", "I would recommend this [Lenovo IdeaPad 3 ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862269YP/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20)\nbecause it comes with AMD Ryzen 5 3500U CPU, 8GB of RAM for smooth multitasking, Good SSD storage of 256GB for faster boot up and loading, 14 inch Full HD screen which is a must have for this price range.\n\nBlack friday deals are here, make sure to check out [my list of best deals on laptops from Walmart, Newegg, eBay, and Amazon](https://laptoplegend.com/2020/black-friday-deals-for-2020/) and you can also [find it here on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/user/LonerIM2/comments/k1oll7/black_friday_laptop_deals_guide_newegg_walmart/)", "AMD isn\u2019t going to expand to the mobile phone market they don\u2019t have enough patents to do that, they don\u2019t have any wireless yet alone cellular modem IP portfolio.\n\nIn the 7-10W range x86 can still be quite competitive.\n\nThis rumor doesn\u2019t makes much sense, and it\u2019s quite likely going to turn out to be quite false or a very very different thing to an M1 competitor.\n\nIn fact a Tegra competitor would make more sense than an M1 now, as in a relatively okish CPU which more or less in line with the high performance application processor cores from ARM like the X1 or the A77/8 and strong GPU.", "All they have in the US is the slim 7 with the 4-core 1065G7 12GB 512GB for $1,100 + tax no discounts.

For the last 6  months life was grand playing many games and having a lot of enjoyment.  That is, until this latest patch from war thunder ruined the graphics  card. As soon as I started playing on the new patch, once every 4 to 5  matches my graphics card would crash. Luckily at first I could just  restart the drivers on the graphics card and all would be fine. After  about 2 weeks of this my graphics card was completely locking up and  crashing my system after 1 or 2 matches. Now, 1 more week later and I  can not get through 1 single match without the entire system crashing to  the ground and requiring a compete reboot sequence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And  now as of tonight, the issue has extended to a post-reboot sequence.  Now even after war thunder client crashes my system, and I cold boot  from a solid state drive, the issue now resides permanently in the  system even when attempting to play other games. Even after a cold  powered-down reboot sequence, my frames have dropped to 30% of what they  were before the war thunder update in ALL GAMES and 3D apps.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Reinstall  the game you say.

If the bios gives an option to disable specific C-states, it might be good to try disable just the higher levels.

It offers the V2748 so that's good.\n\n\nhttps://www.sapphiretech.com/en/commercial/fs-fp6\njust listed now, like a day ago, and they have dual LAN but slower ports however, PCIe gen4 is good.\nI can go to a 4x4 (109.6(L) x 107.3(W)) but then I lose dual RJ45 and it's only 1Gbe and limited to V2718\n\n\nI was very happy with the [5x5 v1000](https://www.sapphiretech.com/en/commercial/fs-fp5#Specification) ( V1807B ) I have from them - I know that the M.2 AX200 WIFI6 will most likely work (it does on mine). I'd not mind another 5*5 Sapphire.\n\n\nFor embedded business case/possibilities: lower costs might well sway any decision - it's the AMD chip that I really want.\nMy personal Dual LAN and higher speed desires are irrelevant for that as network speed is not an factor in my area of work where 1Gbe is plenty.\n\n\nGigabyte:  I have also tried to get info on the Brix https://www.gigabyte.com/MicroSite/549/index.html\n, https://videocardz.com/newz/gigabyte-unveils-brix-s-with-amd-ryzen-4000u-zen2-renoir-processors - no idea on price / availability. Information seems very limited. \nIf the gigabyte have an embedded Intel WIFI6/Bt5.1 (or greater chip than the AX200) etc, it might be convincing - but I suspect they've just used the M.2 port. Again, no info.\n\n\nI'd *really* like sapphires goal of dual 10Gb/s of the original FP5. I waited nearly a year but it never eventuated. It eventually got removed from the site as an offering completely. Something about trying to sort the tech out / something with AMD? Obviously it's a bit of an effort to pack that much punch... nobody else seems to have done it either. I would be mad keen if I saw *that* on the table again.\n\n\nIf there was an m.2 port open for SDD + 1 expansion card, I might find a faster RJ45, kinda like: \nhttps://www.networkconnectors.com.au/nic-mini-pcie-1rj45-plu-818054.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImsvnsK_T7QIVhn0rCh3LMQQjEAQYBCABEgK3wfD_BwE\n\n\nMostly just watching as these things all seem to still be under development.

OptiX is, just like DLSS in gaming, the real MVP and most applications have vastly superior optimization and support for Nvidia cards. That would be the literally only advantage of current AMD cards, the VRam.\n\nAnd yes, I know, AMD did market their cards as purely gaming focused and they're good for it... On the other hand, Nvidia did the same, the RTX 3090 doesn't even get the same optimized drivers, unlike previous Titan cards", "Had a fx6300+750ti and now i have ryzen5 2600 + rx5700, so you cant really tell me that i am a fanboy on Nvidia.

Now its working fine-ish with \\~2 crashes a month. Exact same system worked flawlessly with Nvidia gpu.)\n* Older directX and openGl support from AMD is almost nonexistent so performance in games that use them a significantly worse then on Nvidia' GPUs (java Minecraft for example. Situation is better with linux' MESA Vulkan wrapper, but you cant use shaders with it and Linux is not for everyone)\n* Workstation performance is up to 50% lower compared to CUDA and OptiX\n* Encoder is garbage (just go on youtube and watch comparisons, its awful)\n* No DLSS equivalent", "Unfortunately AMD never figured out or at least published what caused this issues. Why does it happen often for some people and rarely for others. Is it hardware related (e.g. certain mainboards or CPU configurations, PCIe3.0 vs PCIe4.0), game related (DX11 vs DX12), software relate (different OS version)? \nThem being more knowledgeable and open about the problems would have helped the users and maybe even earned back some trust.", "Normally I'd say the Vram is a big advantage, but considering super high res textures are only really required for 4k, and thats where the 3080 shines, it kinda defeats the point. The bigger VRAM might help with console ports, considering how good the new gen is with shifting around memory, but I doubt either card will have much trouble competing with consoles.\n\nTbh its already good to see that AMD has a card that doesnt really perform more slowly in 'normal' titles and is competetively priced, but not quite competetive otherwise. I consider RT to still be near unusable, considering even basic reflections will kill your framerate, but at that price-point you wanna go for the luxury options.\n\nAnd DLSS just seems really quite effective.", "Well:  \n\\-There barely are RT games and all RT implementations at 4K quite frankly suck. Nvidia and AMD are promising stuff they simply can't deliver because their RT hardware is not even close. Frame rates being halved for very simply RT effects with juist one bounce and most still is denoised. That is no where near actual real time ray tracing. It is not even close for shadows or reflections. A basic Global Illumination is the best you could hope for, but that might already be pushing it. At best you are still buying \"beta\" hardware to allow development of software techniques. Don't expect to be able to use RT when hardware evolves and software evolves with it. It will technically run, at horrible frame rates and you will feel left behind. Not the first time this would happen, but RT is a special cause because it is so obvious this came years too soon. On top of that, Hardware Unboxed rapported that using RT seems to increase VRAM usage. That makes perfect sense because the hybrid RT requires a lot of data to check against. That killed the RTX2060 in Cyberpunk 2077 RT. The 10GB is probably fine for the next few years in rasterization, but I would not be so sure about RT. Then again, I don't rate Ampere its RT capabilities either. Being just a bit better than RDNA2 which in turn is just a bit better than Turing, still ends up being terrible.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I want RT. But I realise that hardware is not even remotely close to that dream. In that sense I seriously prefer how AMD did it in RDNA2. AMD seems to have spend as little die size on the hardware as possible, way less than Nvidia did. The focus seems to be far more on rasterisation. For now that ends up in a rough tie, but next year RDNA3 is on the roadmap and from that point onwards, it could get interesting. Rasterisation isn't going anywhere. It will remain the dominant rendering form for the foreseeable future in gaming.   \n\\-DLSS is not \"voodoo magic\" that always works and always is amazing. Very few games actually have it and even then it is the question if it is any good. When it is properly implemented and 2.0, it is really good. When it is 1.0, it tends to get very blurry. Bad 2.0 implementations tends to suffer from artefacts. The whole point of jumping to 4K is the very high pixel density experience to really get the details out. You don't want artefacts then. \n\nThen AMD really needs to learn how to communicate. We get enough stupid marketing nonsense from them, but still nothing on FidelityFX Super Resolution. That would be AMDs \"DLSS\", but the difference is that this is the standard for PS5, XSX/XSS and via PC DirectML which is part of DX12U. If this is even remotely decent, sooner or later, DLSS 2.0 will be killed off. DLSS relies on a proprietary implementation while Super Resolution should run via the DX12U API. It probably is a matter of time before \"DLSS 3.0\" will arrive that also does that.   \n\\-If you are on 1440p high refresh like so many people have been moving to, the RX6800XT is better. Not only is it often a bit faster, but it usually has better frame time consistency, something that usually gets overlooked, but matters and uses less power. And in the end, the RX6800XT should become cheaper than the RTX3080, hopefully...", "They're not saying your experience is instable, they t\n\nThe thing with unstable software is that its gonna play out differently for people, some will have no issues at all.  And historically, the indicators are pretty clear that Nvidia drivers are a lot more stable than AMD drivers.

AMD's Infinity architecture should enable data center chiplets like a CPU + GPU to integrate with reconfigurable FPGAs. When designed properly, it can be a game changer, and Xilinx's FPGAs and Interconnect IPs should help AMD to do that. On the consumer side of things, it might get a bit tricky. Once consumer's perception of ARM as the latest and best becomes mainstream, AMD will need another game changing innovation to compete or at least maintain perceptions in the market.

Plus you add a few more IPs like graphics and Camera.\n\nWhat qualcomm did was license ARM IP, take the basic reference design, add a few of your own IPs (LTE,camera, graphics, etc) and customize it further for your requirement.\n\nApple did the same with A-series chips and is doing the same with M1.\n\nSo you see, while the ARM ISA remains same between Qcom and Apple, their design will not be same..

Rome\u2019s successor, Milan, is already shipping to customers and has already started hitting the channel, and we expect to hear more about the Zen3-based EPYC chips in the coming weeks. I\u2019m not expecting major leaps, but a 20% performance bump is pretty much a safe bet to make \u2013 **it would beat the Q80-33 in more workloads and shift the balance a bit** \u2013 but Ampere\u2019s aggressive pricing would still be something for AMD to worry about.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What really excites me, is the potential of future Altra designs.

We\u2019ll have to see how that scales, but it\u2019ll certainly be a compute monster.

Thank you", "So yes ARM chips are getting faster but there's no reason to believe that apple's M1 is faster just because it's ARM rather than x86.\n\nFor example one of the main reasons why it's so fast is that the RAM is on the SOC, massively lowering latency to both the CPU and GPU. AMD could do this as well - in fact they could do it more easily with their chiplet design than Apple can. The reason they haven't is because they typically sell chips to OEMs who configure the system, customising things like RAM. Previously OEMs (and consumers) may not have liked the inflexibility than on SOC RAM would provide but apple may just demonstate to the market that it's worth it.\n\nAnd don't forget the M1 is being produced on a more advanced node at TSMC than Zen 3 is.\n\nAnd if it came to it, AMD wouldn't even need to just make ARM chips - they could probably design a new instruction set themselves. They did invent x86-x64 afterall. AMD have more technical know-how than you're giving them credit for.\n\nAnd on cloud gaming - it's not replacing consoles any time soon - and likely not ever. The increased latency causes horrible input lag which ruins the gameplay for anything where timing or precision control is important. It will probably exist in parallel with \"traditional\" gaming - and don't forget much of the cloud hardware is currently being built on AMD hardware anyway.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt's good to take threats to AMD seriously and nobody should blindly back a company out of some false sense of loyalty. You're recommendation is also sensible as diversified portfolios should be the norm.\n\nBut you seem to be arguing that people have unrealistically positive expectations and are presuming \"perfect execution\". As far as I can tell though you are being unrealistically pessimistic and are presuming ARM will take over the world without any real evidence.", "That is unlikely, as AMD is short on 7nm production capacity at TSMC, and APUs are 2x bigger 7nm dies than Zen3 chiplets, but CPU in them is weaker. Thus, it does not make sense to sell them in retail till there is more than enough production for all other product lines (CPUs, dGPUs, APUs for notebooks).", "Some valid points in the short thesis.  Counter points:\n\n- ISA shift happens a lot slower than you think especially in the PC market.\n- Another generation of console is already in the works.  Unless most of the market can stream 4K with low latency there will be a market for consoles and gaming PCs.\n- Console gaming market is still growing.  It will remain x86 and AMD for years to come.\n- AMD doesn\u2019t need to monopolize x86 market for stock to go up.  It just has to continue to grow EPS at 30% for a few more years.  \n- PC vendors have no incentives to sell ARM PCs right now, as Apple isn\u2019t selling M1.  Gamers all want x86.\n- AMD still have at least a year or two before competitors catch up with chiplet.  So they have the cost advantage in server space.\n- We don\u2019t know how Nvidia acquisition will affect  the Arm ecosystem. \n- x86 CPUs are binary compatible with 10+ years of software.  Different ARM vendors likely will require recompile, or different ports of the OS.  For decades many ISAs try to replace x86 but failed.  In fact intel tried multiple times to move away from x86 and failed.\n- If Rome is having such hard time displacing Xeons, what makes you think that Ampere and Nuvia can have more success?  So far no one has produced a server chip that is better than AMD by a decent margin.  Ampere is going to compete against Milan in 2021 and Genoa in 2022.  If Nuvia comes out with a great server chip it will take a few years to make a dent.\n- AMD has almost zero share in AI.  What are the odds that they will gain some market share?

Apple has nothing to offer for people looking a gaming laptop either.\n\n- Datacenter\n\nNo Apple presence here either.\n\n-------------------\n\nIs ARM an existential threat to x86? In the long run, sure. \n\nIs AMD tied to x86? Not really. \n\nWould an AMD ARM processor be competitive? Honestly, I don't know. I place more weight on TSMC when it comes to AMDs newfound performance lead over Intel than I do on AMDs engineers, and AMD doesn't have the same out-of-the-park homerun process advantage against their ARM competitors.\n\n&gt;Are we fucked?\n\nNo. Things are still mostly rosy. Intel and Nvidia are still the companies to beat. Intel won't really be a technological problem until 2023-2024, Nvidia is still mostly out of the reach for AMD in terms of machine learning (and CUDA), but AMD can still grab market share in AIB's and laptop dGPUs.\n\nThings to look out for aside from Intel and Nvidia: datacenter ARM CPUs. We're talking Gravitron and Ampere.", "Tbf the 3090 is more than double the price of product it\u2019s +10% over. So \u201conly\u201d $350 is still less of a price hike.\n\nBut anyway, this thing is a joke. You\u2019re paying 50 percent more for a few percent better than 3080 raster performance, and notably worse raytracing perf. Nvidia could render it completely irrelevant with a 3080 Ti if they wanted, but I expect it\u2019ll be priced more like $1200.\n\nAt this point I think the only really interesting part of the 6000 series is the 6800, and that pretty much just because it covers a price segment Nvidia doesn\u2019t + has so much VRAM for the cost. This generation has been fun to watch inasmuch as AMD nipping at Nvidia\u2019s heels in raster, but with the present pricing I\u2019d be hard pressed to recommend anyone actually buy a 6000 series over the equivalent 30 series.", "Don't agree at all, 3080 just makes so much more sense right now, is more readily available and cheaper in many places than a 6800.\n\nThis is coming from someone who has bought AMD GPUs for more than 15 years now. This is def closer than normal for AMD but their paper launches really killed their chance to compete this gen. I am not going to even go into the raytracing debacle that AMD is trying to find a way to match.", "Probably a decent chunk. AMD has a pretty big bunch of fans that are fiercely loyal to them. The 6900 XT really isn't meant for the mainstream market. Much like the 3090 isn't either. Its priced for a niche market. Its really made for the loyal fan.", "Yeah I agree, the 3080 is just more proven. I don\u2019t doubt AMD could outright win next cycle but they still have a lot to prove. I really hope they do deliver on improved RT, DLSS competitor, and a good encoder.", "As someone who has a 3070 and is having a blast in Cyberpunk with RT and DLSS, keep the 3080. The featureset is too good to pass up. AMD \\*might\\* get something which performs similarly but if the current RT benchmarks are any indication then that won't be the case (at least for a long while).", "Is update 1.05 out for it now on PC?  I have an AMD CPU and even with my RX580 I've been able to get it to the point where I'm happy with it.  On one hand if 1.05 fixes some bugs I want it, but if it's going to fuck the FPS up then I don't want it....", "Yeah I do have cyberpunk so that\u2019s a big consideration. I am more excited for Far Cry 6, which is an AMD title though. However even if it\u2019s optimized for AMD with RT, that might not be enough to outdo the 3080 with more raw RT power. Pretty sure I am sticking with the 3080", "tq for replying! true enough about the 3060ti, still hunting here, probably gonna take any version that i could find at the local store. might change the ram too, doesn't really wanted too much of rgb actually, but i heard Trident ram is slightly better for AMD cpu, don't know if it's true or not", "Turns out the game wasn't using SMT and only using physical cores on AMD CPUs. Someone found a fix that worked across the board (hex edit) and enabled SMT. Then today they released a patch where they coded in the SMT fix but only for 4 and 6 core CPUs, citing they didn't see a difference with higher core count AMD CPUs. They also removed the means to manually turn it on probably out of spite so now if you have an 8 core CPU or higher you can't use SMT.\n\nTL:DR - With the latest patch they removed the hex edit option for SMT on AMD 8 core or higher CPUS.\n\nhttps://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37166/hotfix-1-05", "more the reason against AMD - CUDA for compute.", "Few reasons really. \n\nBetter Linux support and not doing stuff like the GPP or HUB \"scandal\" *as much*. \n\nI've also been personally burnt by Nvidia but not by AMD (I skipped Vega :P) so I'd rather buy AMD. \n\nIn the end though, I'm likely gonna buy the 3080Ti.

When crossfire/sli is on, only one card can output video and vram is not combined (because both cards need to have all the information stored at all times, processing is split between the cards, vram is not).\n\nShould try to consider first a more powerful GPU. I'm guessing your lags is not because of vram, unless your actually running code in the GPU with GP-GPU enabled software. 4x 4k monitors is probably enough pixels to push a RX 580, even if its not rendering anything too heavy.\n\nThings get more complicated if you do need more vram though, because there's not many alternatives.

In this case, a bunch of different students could tackle their own part of the problem to get it done faster. The more students you have (the more cores you have), the faster you can do it.\n\nHowever, if you give the class (the CPU) a math problem that is extremely difficult but with only one component, you'd give it to one student to do. That would be a single core dependant task, which gaming is kind of. In this case, you'd want that one student to be as fast as possible, and you wouldn't need a lot of students. Therefore, with things like gaming, single core speed matters a little more. \n\nGaming these days runs fairly smoothly on 6 cores, although we may begin to see the need for 8 several years down the line. 4 is the bare minimum nowadays, to be perfectly honest.

Also wait for the realease of more ryzen 5000 CPUs.", "Hey OP \u2014 Tech Support posts are only allowed in the [Q4'20 Tech Support Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/j5xy4o/q420_tech_support_megathread/)\n\nYou may also wish to visit /r/AMDHelp and /r/TechSupport", "Oh. That's a lot of time, maybe there will be new GPUs by than, from AMD for say and there are rumers that intel will release a gpu too.", "it will mostly be the same throughout all different brands except the style of efficiency of the coolers included. Each brand will also add a little overclock from the factory which will make it just minimally better than the reference card, in this case from AMD.", "From what I know.  Each of those companies sell the same card with a different cooling solution.  That\u2019s pretty much the difference between all of them.  Each manufacturer has a different cooler and visual appearance.  This allows some to have slightly higher clocks than the other.  The performance gap is pretty minimal with the major difference being noise and temps.  AMD does make their own.", "Man, I wish I could find it but I saw a really good explanation that is much better than what I can emulate from memory.\n\nThis is specifically for NVIDIA GPU's. \n\n100 GPU's are made, they are NVIDIA RTX 3080's. \n\nOf these 100, 25 clock 50% faster than the rest. These are labelled \"3080Ti's\". \n\nOf the remaining 75, 25 clock 25% faster than the reset. These are labelled the \"3080 Super\".  \n\nOf the remaining 50, 25 clock at NVIDIA's expected baseline for the 3080, so they are also labelled \"3080\". \n\nOf the remaining 25, these clock 25% under the expected baseline. These are labelled \"3070's\". \n\nThe user I saw had a much more concise (and likely accurate) chart, but I think this may give some insight and can somewhat be applied all the way down. \n\n2080's that run under expected baseline performance are labelled as a 2070, but it may clock higher than the expected baseline for a 2070 so it gets the tag Super. \n\nThere's some variance with VRAM which also affects these labels, but I'm not informed enough to be able to explain that lol. \n\nNow, to answer what you're actually asking, the simple answer is capitalism lol. Why are there different car manufacturers, grocery stores, etc? Cause people see a resource and want to see how they can enhance it. \n\nASUS recently announced that they are making a 3080 with 20GB of VRAM, which is an entirely different card from every other 3080, including ones ASUS has already released. So in this case, ASUS is providing themselves as an option for a general retailer, as well as a niche market for power users. Similarly, EVGA will compete with ASUS as a general retailer for GPU's, but has their own specialized market for power users which will also be competing with ASUS and other GPU distributors. \n\nThat's about the limit of what I think I can say without speaking out of my ass more than I already have, *however* what I think would be a beneficial way to tie this all together would be to say that those 100GPU's each are distributed from NVIDIA to these individual distributors, ASUS, EVGA, Aurous, Gigabyte. Each of those get 100GPU's which they then brand and market. For the niche power-user cards, I think these companies specifically work together with NVIDIA to create it.\n\nI can't say much for AMD, I've never understood their naming scheme lol. Love their processors, can't understand their GPU's.", "Remember to get an Nvidia GPU, these are much better than AMD GPUs for 3D modeling and animation. \n\nThe 5800X and 5900X are the sweet spots. I have both, the 5900X is decidedly more powerful overall with 12 cores. The 5800x is better for gaming as the cores do clock higher. \n\nThe 5950x will likely be slower as the cores will end up running slower unless you have a very insane cooling system. The 12 core 5900x has been difficult to keep cool, and I've not been able to overclock it at all, so I'm now researching the process of custom loop water cooling just for it. \n\nFor a 5950x you definitely want a custom loop system with at least 4-5 fans to get max performance. This costs hundreds on top of it. \n\nThe 5900X will work acceptably with a 3x fan AIO. \n\nTe 5800x is acceptable with a dual fan air cooler.", "None of the above. The TUF has very very bad heating issues. Like 95plus degree centigrade  average. It sometimes reaches 105 degree. \n\nACER Nitro has heating issues as well (not as bad though). \n\nI would strongly suggest HP OMEN/Lenovo Legion 5 AMD.", "&gt;it will mostly be the same throughout all different brands except the style of efficiency of the coolers included. Each brand will also add a little overclock from the factory which will make it just minimally better than the reference card, in this case from AMD.\n\nohhh that make sense.. but are they chipper or just a waste? and would you consider buying one if for example right now most  high end gpus are out of stock would you consider buying the somewhat same gpu with slight bump in cooling or efficiency from the brands i just said  r just wait for re stock in this case form AMD?", "Yes this.\n\nIt seems AMD\u2019s made a sidebar diagnostic of sorts &amp; intended it to be used over everything.. I agree it\u2019d be better if it atleast had an option to only display in for example Fullscreen games.\n\nThat and for certain overlays to not be included in ReLive recordings.", "Geekbench is not a reliable source for determining system performance especially those using different architectures or operating systems.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Infact I\u2019d go as far as to say that the industry should reject synthetic benchmarks entirely and rely on \u201creal\u201d benchmarks. IE Blender renders, Premier Pro renders(Kdenlive or Davinci for use Linux users), application complie tests. Reddit user u/OmNomDeBonBon made a great comment explaing this better that I could ever do.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 JFYI, Geekbench isn\u2019t taken seriously in the PC space. It\u2019s only useful for measuring differences in performance between chips of the same architecture and similar design e.g. going from A12 to A13, or Ryzen 2600 to Ryzen 3600.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s not useful for measuring performance differences between different implementations of the same ISA from different OEMs e.g. A13 and SD855, or i5-8400 to Ryzen 2600.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 tl;dr: A13 is faster but we won\u2019t know how much faster until we get real-world benchmarks, not Geekbench.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Edit: a lot of people are asking me to justify my analysis, so let me explain why Geekbench and other similar testing suites aren\u2019t taken seriously amongst most of the technical press and the wider enthusiast market. This has turned into an effortpost, so I hope at least one person gets something useful out of this. Scroll down to the end for the overall tl;dr.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BUSINESS MODEL: why do they say we need their benchmark?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Here are some examples of highly questionable benchmarking organisations:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Geekbench\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 FutureMark (3dmark, PCmark, VRmark, etc.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Passmark (PassMark, BurnInTest, the hilarious \u201cMemTest x86 Pro\u201d)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Userbenchmark\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What do they have in common? Their product is their benchmark. Geekbench is freemium/paid, FutureMark and Passmark products are paid, and Userbenchmark relies on click-through ad revenue and SEO optimisation spam.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is unlike benchmarks like, say, Cinebench, where the actual product is Cinema 4D, a professional 3D modelling/rendering application. The benchmark suite itself (Cinebench) is free with no \u201cpremium edition\u201d - the benchmark exists to tell consumers how different CPUs will handle Cinebench. Likewise, PC games often feature built-in benchmarks, designed to offer repeatable performance measurement in a controlled environment.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The likes of Geekbench and Futuremark have business models which rely upon convincing consumers that the GB/FM performance metrics are trustworthy. They are multiple ways they achieve this, but the easiest method with the highest ROI is to just optimise your benchmark for the market leader\u2019s products. Passmark, for example, is notoriously biased towards Intel, because Intel have ~80% desktop market share and people who buy Passmark likely won\u2019t buy Passmark again if it shows their Intel CPU scored less than a competing AMD CPU. This has the benefit of meaning the market leader will trumpet the benchmark product(s) in its marketing materials - masses of free advertising the benchmarking company, leading to more sales of their benchmarking products.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A benchmarking company\u2019s entire existence is contingent upon convincing consumers to buy their product, convincing the biggest players to use their product in marketing slides, and convincing hardware/software reviewers to purchase the enterprise editions of the benchmark. They have a profit motive to get you to think their products give consumers useful data, when they don\u2019t. I\u2019ll explain why later.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 HISTORY: why do we have synthetic benchmarks in the first place?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The ONLY REASON we ever needed synthetic benchmarks was because repeatable benchmarking of commonly used applications in a controlled environment used to be extremely expensive and time-consuming. Decades ago, if you wanted to do a set of benchmarks, you needed a computer that could run 2D and 3D games, MS Office, 3d modelling apps, batch jobs in image editing software, video/audio encoding and so on. Not only was the total cost of this software prohibitive, but the cost of the PC you\u2019d need to bench these products would be through the roof. Additionally, it\u2019d take days to run all of the benchmarks and up to a week to analyse and visualise the data in a way that\u2019d make sense to a consumer.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is where AIO benchmark suites came in - they provided a highly synthetic benchmark suite which might take anywhere from a minute to a couple of hours, and would spit out a simple to understand numeric score. 17849 is better than 15838, right? The cost of the benchmarking application might\u2019ve only been $100, so something like 1/10th the cost of buying those real-world applications for benchmarking. So, the reviewer not only saved over a week of time, but they saved hundreds/thousands of dollars by not buying all the apps you need to run the benches. So, synthetic benchmarks gained widespread popularity, as a more feasible alternative to real-world benches.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ACCURACY: do they reflect real-world performance?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lastly, there\u2019s the efficacy of these benchmarks. Geekbench, Passmark, 3dmark et al often produce results which aren\u2019t representative of real-world applications. This defeats the entire purpose of these benchmarks, whose stated goal is to give you performance metrics representative of real-world use. An excellent example is in this thread: Apple\u2019s SoCs destroy Qualcomm Snapdragon, Samsung Exynos and Huawei Kirin in Geekbench, yet this destruction isn\u2019t replicated in real-world application benchmarks.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, real-world speed tests from the last few years almost always show Samsung\u2019s Qualcomm-based Galaxy S and Note phones beating the iPhones despite the iPhones having a SoC which demolishes Qualcomm\u2019s SoCs in Geekbench. Hell, the inferior Exynos Galaxy S10+ (which is slower than the Snapdragon S10) beats the iPhone XS Max in speed tests: Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus vs iPhone XS Max Speed Test! (Exynos 9820) - YouTube This is despite the iPhone XS Max smoking both the Snapdragon and Exynos variants of the S10+ in Geekbench. There are also videos of the Galaxy Note10+ (same SD 855 as the S10+) beating the iPhone XS Max by an embarrassingly wide margin in speed tests covering a dozen or so popular mobile apps (Spotify, Facebook, Insta, YouTube, Subway Surfer, etc.).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Another example is Userbenchmark. This company was caught changing their scoring system to benefit Intel after AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 3000 series started destroying Intel\u2019s objectively inferior CPUs in their benchmark. They now rank inferior Intel CPUs above superior AMD ones, because they have a business incentive to tip the scales in favour of Intel. Another is BAPCo, a benchmarking company which modified their entire benchmark so that it ran just one test in a loop, a test which just so happened to heavily favour Intel CPUs. Before the modification, the benchmark showed AMD CPUs destroying Intel CPUs. It was then revealed BAPCo was funded by Intel, and this contributed to a court case where Intel to this day still needs to make special disclosures about its benchmarking that nobody else does. https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1009264/the-case-against-bapco\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SUMMARY\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The tl;dr here is, these synthetic benchmarks do not reflect real-world performance to an acceptable level of accuracy, and they should absolutely not be factored into buying decisions. Geekbench and other synthetic benchmarking suites don\u2019t produce useful data unless you want to compare two CPUs of the same architecture with a similar design from the same vendor e.g. to test generational improvements between A12 and A13, or to test scaling between 6-core Ryzen 3600 and 8-core Ryzen 3700X. Gamers, photographers, 3D modellers, etc. generally don\u2019t give a damn about Geekbench, because they see first-hand how the Geekbench score doesn\u2019t reflect real-world performance when you compare different implementations of the same ISA e.g. Intel and AMD, let alone different ISAs (e.g. Apple comparing ARM A13 to an x86 laptop CPU).", "You pick the best of everything but go for an AMD GPU ?

Decide and pull the trigger knowing the cons and choose to live with it.\n\n1) Poor ergonomics; you'll find yourself breaking grip in order to reach for buttons and hats. Not a deal breaker for me and have lived with it. I also made some modifications to make it livable.\n\n2) It requires a lot of juice. The throttle quadrant sucks up a lot of power. Not even the motherboard's 3.0 USB can give it enough power. Hence you might get ghosting issues. Easily solved by buying a powered USB hub.\n\n3) Throttle grease. It seems that the grease on the thing were the sticky kind and just kind of annoying. It has become less of a problem for me in the long run as repeated use have evened things out.\n\n\nThe one thing nice about the 56 is that it's versatile. You can easily have enough keybinds for any aircraft without needing modifiers and still have plenty left as extra.\n\n\nTrack IR; if mine ever breaks, I'll refuse to fly. That said; you can live without it in the meantime. You can use one of the hats + a button to control where you look.\n\n\nUnless you're flying helicopters; rudders also aren't that crucial. If you're flying an FBW aircraft, even less so. I've lived with a twist rudder for three years on a helicopter before buying my first pedal. In fact; I'm more precise on a twist rudder than a pedal.\n\n\nYour planned rig seems decent; although I can't really speak as to how good the AMD products are (I'm team green/ intel).", "In general, when you are writing and reading data from files for the purposes of constructing a code object, this is known as serialization. Rather than create your own serialization format and employ `re`, it may be more simple and extensible and reusable, to use a preexisting format.

If it's the cable length then you should have reduced the length a bit.

The TDP of a CPU is essentially how much power a CPU will pull. The higher the TDP of a CPU, the more power is drawn, so more heat is generated, so more to cool. \n\nAMD has 65 Watts, 95 Watts, and 105 Watts TDP CPUs. The Ryzen 5 3600 you selected is a 65 Watt CPU. 65 Watt CPUs can be easily cooled with a simple budget to midrange air cooler. The 105 Watt CPUs need either a high quality air cooler, or liquid cooling. The 95 Watt CPUs are somewhere in between.\n\nSo for your Ryzen 5 3600, most simple air coolers will do the trick.

It is a poor man's business laptop.\n\nGet L14 or T14, better build quality.", "It\u2019s simply that most versions of AMD processors does not support Thunderbolt. Some desktop CPUs do, but not all. Hopefully with the new gen AMD CPUs, it will change, and personally, I really hope that they\u2019ll get USB4 support as well. \n\nAs far as I know, Thunderbolt is not intel\u2019s, but they have a broader support.", "Whichever the cheapest and in stock.\n\nBoth of these GPUs perform similarly that your only consideration would be price and whether you want to run Linux-based program or not.\n\nIt's a pain to configure Nvidia cards to work with Linux compared to \"usually out of the box\" experience for AMD cards.", "Okay, [here](https://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Bulldozer/AMD-A12-Series%20A12-9720P.html) are your CPU specs.  Really not a bad CPU at all.\n\n\n4 cores\nAES, AVX and AVX2 instructions\n\nCache:\n\nL1i: 2 x 96 KB\n\nL1d: 4 x 32 KB\n\nL2: 2 x 1 MB\n\nMemory: 2 channels supporting DDR4-1866\n\nThe GPU is integrated with the CPU (on the same chip.)  Therefore, I wouldn't recommend using the GPU for mining.\n\nYour CPU doesn't have any L3 cache, so its Monero (RandomX algorithm) hashrate probably won't be the best.  You should try mining Monero by mining alternative coins at [MoneroOcean](https://moneroocean.stream/) mining pool.\n\nYou will need a Monero address to mine to.  For this, it's best if you setup the *official* Monero GUI or CLI.  There are instructions on how to do this... I've never used the GUI and I don't use Windows.  I would only be helpful at telling you how to setup the Monero CLI on Linux (Ubuntu.)  But once you get the *official* Monero software setup and you have generated a Monero wallet address for yourself, then you can try mining with xmrigMO.  *Official* Monero wallet software downloads and instructions on setting it up are here: https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/\n\nOnce you have a Monero wallet address, you can start mining.  Download the latest release of xmrigMO [here.](https://github.com/MoneroOcean/xmrig/releases) Unzip it and put your Monero address in the config.json file (it tells you where to put it.)  On Windows, 7zip is the best for unzip/zip, you can download that [here.](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900-x64.exe)\n\nAfter you edit config.json to include your Monero wallet address, run xmrigMO (xmrig.exe) as Administrator.  It will take ~2 minutes testing many different mining algorithms and it will automatically save your CPU's performance for each of those algorithms in the config.json file.  This tells MoneroOcean pool which algorithm your CPU can mine best and the pool will automatically tell your CPU which algorithm to mine based on whichever one is most profitable in real-time.  You can go to Moneroocean.stream and paste in your Monero address to watch the progress of your miner.  MoneroOcean has no mining fee (0%), just a small withdrawal fee for withdrawals under 4 XMR (Monero.)  The pool makes money to pay for operations from these withdrawal fees and from the trading fee deltas (when the pool automatically sells mined altcoins for Monero; every miner gets paid in Monero.)  I use MoneroOcean pool and I've never had a problem with it.\n\nI think your CPU would be most profitable mining *panthera* algorithm.  This algorithm mines well on high core counts with high clock speed without needing the L3 cache Monero needs for best hashrate.  Your CPU will probably get quite hot mining *panthera* because it's a very core intensive mining algorithm.  You can still mine regular Monero (*RandomX*) to MoneroOcean pool as well, you just won't get the best hashrate without L3 cache.  Maybe ~200 H/s on your CPU.  You'd probably get ~500 H/s on *panthera* (average ~80% profitability of Monero) so equal to ~400 Monero H/s.  Monero (RandomX) isn't very core intensive (it uses more RAM memory) so it won't get as hot when mining.  I think your laptop should be fine to mine on... I've mined on many laptops without issue, but they don't get much hashrate.  Also mining will damage your laptop's battery over time.  This is because you need to leave your laptop plugged in to mine and leaving it plugged in keeps the Li-ion battery at max voltage which is bad for the battery cells.  If your laptop has a removable battery, I recommend removing it and mining with the laptop plugged in (without the battery) so it doesn't stress the Li-ion cells.\n\nI hope this helps you get started.  Beware of 3rd party software for Monero wallets and/or for mining.  There are a lot of phishing scams out there.  It's best to use the *official* Monero software releases (verify the checksum hash like it says on getmonero.org) and avoid miner scams like minergate because they fake your hashrate and skim (if not outright steal) from you."], "2021-01-06": ["As an AMD fan, in this case Intel makes more sense.", "I have an AMD FX-8350, so i know how capable this old chipsets are but your gpu will be your bottleneck.\nHonestly, if you upgrade your gpu to something more recent (GTX 1080 ti or above) you could run most modern games at mid to high settings at 1080p.\n\n- Fortnite, \n- Unturned, \n- Any Source Engine Game\n- Minecraft Java (at 720p)\n\nThose are a few i can think of at the top of my head, but i highly recommend going to \"can i run it?\" And seeing what's available for you there \ud83d\ude01\n\nHope this helps!", "Fortnite Recommended System Requirements\n\nIn order to run Fortnite on recommended settings, we suggest a Core i5 2.8GHz processor or greater, 8GB of system RAM, and a 2GB video card such as the Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 7870 equivalent DX11 GPU.\n\nAs for other games, prolly not anything new in regards to AAA unless you want to play lowest settings &amp; resolution with poor fps.

AMD overclocking capable motherboards aren't that expensive as far as I know. I have a gigabyte ab350m, it was barely more expensive than the cheapest AM4 mobo available locally (+4 euro I think). I'm sure I'm missing advanced features, but I Can overclock on it. Running my 1600 at 3.85 all core.\n2. This is kind of a point for both in that case, but I wouldn't worry about future proofing further if you're buying an 3100 etc. You can upgrade to 5000 series and more cores down the line and still use the same chipset. I'd personally do that as an interim upgrade instead of completely rerolling to a new chipset/PC in a few years.  \n\n\nThose being said. The i3 is cheaper and faster. For me it would depend on how likely I am to stick an upgraded (maybe bought used) CPU in the same PC later.   \n\n\nIf I'm not and I'm keeping this for a while, then I'd get the i3 due to price/speed.

Going AMD with the cheap OC + wifi mobo : Ryzen 3 1300 (INR 9,990) + Gigabyte B450M DS3H WiFi (INR 9,650) = 19,640 for the combo . Taking Intel with cheapest decent Wifi mobo, I'll have i3 10100F (8,590) + Gigabyte B460M DS3H AC (INR 9,490) = 18,080 which is about 8% (INR 1560 or 17.3 Euros) cheaper .

This rig for the 12th grade and college, I won't upgrade anything much.  So this should last me 5 or so years; I'll upgrade the GPU if needed. Even if I wanted to upgrade the CPU, all the 10th and 11th gen Intel CPUs are always going to work, and AFAIK the used prices for Ryzen are going to be very high because of the hype ; Intel CPUs are likely to go cheaper for used and be just as good for gaming.", "I have an I5 10500 and it rocks in r6 and csgo, but yet again you should probably go for something AMD", "Have you considered a ryzen 5 2600?

As far as I am aware, extending the screen, or setting the monitor to the primary display, does not have a significant effect on performance.\n4. You have a video card that will be compatible with G Sync (Nvidias Tech). Free sync is AMD technology and would only be compatible with their cards. While you definitely want G sync for PC Gaming ( i Would not consider a display without it), Free sync will not hurt if it is there, but dont pay extra just to have it. Bear in mind some displays say Free sync (G sync compatible). These generally work for nvidia cards, but some monitors dont behave as well as a monitor labelled just g sync, so that would require looking at reviews of the specific monitor. Some free sync (g sync compatible) monitors are reported to flicker when using g sync.\n\nI hope this helps.", "There is no real point in 'lightly' overclocking a Ryzen CPU due to the way multi core and single core clocks are managed on those CPUs.

But you are correct, not all of the generation have a X700 non-X, X700X and X800X (e.g. there was no 2800X).   \nBut that wasn't my point; my point was that, while we have seen those monikers before, we have *never* seen a X800 non-X (no 1800, 2800 or 3800). \n\nYou are also correct that the X *usually* indicates a lower TDP (though AMD has gone against this as well by making the 3700X a 65W part). Following that train of thought: Why would you have two numbers (7 and 8) indicating two tiers, where there isn't much differentiating the two? Why would AMD not keep the 8-tier for 65W and 105W CPU with 8-cores and 16-threads and free up the 7-tier for something new?\n\nMy fear is that this \"something new\" is SMT-disabled 8 core processors.", "Disable CSM.

The 5700G name has already shown up on USB-IF, we know the 5700G is going to be the moniker for the fully enabled Cezanne die on AM4.

Thus a 5700 without SMT seems like a very illogical  concern. \n\nThat is the only thing that stands against my worry - that there is already an SMT enabled 5700 part coming.   \nGiven the recent history of AMD pricing plus not being too precise with their naming (see e.g. the 3700X being 65W or the rumoured Cezanne and Lucienne parts both being called Ryzen 5000s), I wouldn't say it is illogical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;What's even more illogical is believing that AMD/TSMC has the  manufacturing capabilities and/or the yields the require so many SKUs. \n\nThat is not illogical either: AMD only produces one kind of CPU die with TSMC's 7nm process and that is the chiplet die that goes into every single Ryzen 5000 CPU. There is no physical differences between them other than manufacturing defects. The way they segment their product lines is to disable parts of the die. If you have too few market segments, you may end up disabling good parts of the die, so more segmentation ultimately means more revenue for them. We also see this trend towards increased market segmentation and higher prices in Intel and NVidia.   \nI won't be surprised if AMD steps up their segmentation game as well and makes cheaper products increasingly unappealing to incentivize their customers to buy higher-priced products.

But it'll be plenty for work and trading, with support for 4 monitors.\n\nThe 3700X is a great all-around CPU for both gaming and workstation tasks. It has good single-core performance for gaming and will last a long time thanks to its 8c/16t.\n\nThe 3700X comes with an okay stock cooler, but it can get quite loud and toasty under load. So I went with the standard Hyper 212 Black. It'll be perfect for the 65W TDP 3700X while operating quietly thanks to a lower RPM required.\n\nI chose a high value B550 motherboard. It has good connectivity and power delivery while also offering WiFi and Bluetooth.\n\nI included 32 GB of fast 3600 MHz CL18 RAM, which should be useful for having multiple trading apps open and plenty for gaming.\n\nI chose a 500 GB NVMe SSD as your boot drive and for your frequently used programs/games.   I also added a 2 TB HDD for your media and other games. On the flip side, you could get a [1 TB SSD](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/product/zR3H99/adata-sx8200-1-tb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-asx8200pnp-1tt-c) instead of this SSD+HDD combo.\n\n**The GPU is not widely available** due to major shortages in stock and sky-high levels of demand. And for this budget, I wouldn't go with any other GPU than the RTX 3070, as it's great for 1440p gaming. It's not relevant for your work or trading (besides displaying a lot graphs) but you'll need it for your \"pretty crazy monitors\". You'll have to monitor r/hardwareswap or sites like Amazon/Newegg/CanadaComputers/MemEx for restocks, but I guess you're used to that with trading.\n\nThe Meshify C Mini is a fantastic case, with excellent airflow and cable management. It comes with two fans; I added one for more airflow and positive pressure, which should prevent dust build-up in the case.\n\nThe PSU has great value right now. At 650W, it's perfect for these components and it has fully modular cables. It has excellent reviews and has good protections.

If NVMe drives are cheap in the future, you can always wipe the A1000 SSD and replace it with another PCIe 4.0 SSD.

I see many people recommending the 5600x or 5800x and I have to say that seems dumb in my opinion. They are not bad CPUs they just aren't competitive. I will start with the 5800x and why you shouldn't buy it. It has an msrp of 450$ and has 8 very fast cores, but it is not a good value whatsoever. The 10700k and 9900k can now be had at 100$ less and during Christmas for 150$ less and they both have 8 slightly slower, but still very fast cores. That is not taking into account that the 10700k and 9900k are in stock.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;People are now buying AMD just because well AMD is better haha intel 14nm I comedy. Just to make people realize how dumb this is 3 years ago intel released the 9900k for the same price as the 5800x although it sold for 50$ higher, but it was in stock. Everybody was bitching about it like oh who would buy a 9900k the 2700x is 150-200$ less and it has 8 cores. Now tell me would you consider a 2700x a cpu worthy of a 3090. The 9900k was worth the money over the 2700x although over the 3900x and 3700x it became a hard pass. Now we are in this same situation 3 years later except the 5800x is the really expensive cpu and the 9900k is the cheaper option.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;People were bitching about the 9900k at release even though the price at the time wasn't crazy, but when AMD does the same thing 3 years later nobody blinks a fucking eye. What I am trying to say is that the 5800x just doesn't make sense. I mean look the 10850k is going for 400$ and the 3900x should be going for 400$ too. The 5800x is just a really bad value and nobody should buy it. Next up is the 5600x and this one is one that really gets on my nerves. The 5600x is not the deal ok. Just because you saw a benchmark showing it had higher fps does not mean it is worth the 300$.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Bench marks never tell the whole story and we must consider that for 300$ you should probably get an 8 core chip in 2020. We have been seeing intel beat AMD in gaming for years and nobody was ever like oh yeah we should only get intel because look at those fps numbers. Now when AMD does the same thing and charge a price premium over intel for slightly better gaming performance everybody praises it. The 5600x is 6 cores for 300$. Like what the fuck the 8700k came out 4 years ago and it was 870$ for a 6 very fast cores and people were like, but bro Ryzen is so cool. The 5900x and 5950x are great value in my opinion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;and personally when looking at the 8 core chips a 10700k looks really nice for the price.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHey /u/Zucini-noodles, it looks like you posted a wall of text.

The Intel Z590 chipset does *not* provide Gen4, it is Gen3, just like Z490/Z390/Z370, etc. Only the primary PCI Express slot(s) and one NVMe M.2 are connected at Gen4, via the CPU when used with an 11th generation series CPU.\n\nZ590 boards *do* include a wider x8 DMI 3.0 link (\\~8GB/s) between the chipset and CPU, which will help alleviate bottlenecking in cases where several additional drives or peripherals are used simultaneously, but anything connected to the chipset is still just Gen3. Z490 and older use an x4 DMI 3.0 link, for an effective \\~4GB/s between the chipset and CPU, so this is still a good upgrade for anyone working with video editing or other large local files.\n\nSome board manufacturers will work around this by switching lanes between what would normally be a second slot in a typical x16/x0 and x8/x8 mode setup, so instead of x16+x4 for the main slot and NVMe M.2 drive, you'd end up with x8+x4/x4+x4, allowing three full speed Gen4 NVMe M.2 drives, but running the GPU at x8 as a compromise.\n\nGigabyte's [Z590 Vision G](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/Z590-VISION-G-rev-10#kf) is one such example, allowing a total of [four NVMe M.2 drives](https://imgur.com/a/YOlk0R0) (three Gen4 via CPU, one Gen3 via chipset, with the GPU at x8). They did a similar move with the B550 Master on the AMD side of things.\n\nMost of the manufacturers have their Z590 motherboard pages posted up now, so it's possible to thumb through and get a feel for how the boards are laid out.

The other thing that might make the motherboard obsolete, in the sense that it can't be used for the next generation future tech, is that the DDR5 memories will probably be out sometime around the end of this year, and the physical form factors for each generation of the DIMMs for the DDR3/DDR4/DDR5 are different.

Good morning. Congratulations, Lisa and Victor, both on the deal and Lisa on the solid results. My first question is just on the core business and gross margins.*\n\n*And I apologize because I've been bouncing around a couple of calls this morning. But Lisa, I'm wondering, how much -- there were some news presses in the calendar third quarter that perhaps the ramp on the gaming side had incurred some more costs than originally expected. But I guess, importantly, when you look at gaming as a percent of mix and the fact that Q3 is kind of the first gaming quarter which just tends to be the lowest gross margin quarter, it strikes me that September should be a gross margin bottom for the overall business. I'm wondering if you could just help me understand if that's a fair comment and how I should think about improvement in gross margin in gaming over time.*\n\n***Lisa Su*** *-- President and Chief Executive Officer*\n\n*Yeah. Sure, John. So certainly, we ramped heavily the console business here in the third quarter. I think we were right at our margin guidance.*\n\n*As we go sequentially into the fourth quarter, we saw -- we see an increase in margins from 44% to 45%. I think there are a couple of aspects there. So we do have the console business growing sequentially. And so that is a bit margin-decretive.*\n\n*However, we also have our other businesses growing as well that offset that. It is true that the early parts of the console ramp are -- typically, we're working through some ramp issues. I would say the ramp is going quite well, and the demand environment is very strong overall. And we continue to work on satisfying all of the demand.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Lisa confirmed \"we won't be able to meet demand in any segment\" until well after Nvidia has a steady supply of Tis and Supers to undercut our ~~$549~~ ~~$579~~ ~~$799?~~ cards. \n\n *Lisa Su discussed the timeline for a recovery, saying,* ***\"****Paul, we are shipping a lot of parts.

If the cc does not clarify that situation adequately I'm going to increase my diversification pace and take the 3.8% tax hit.  If AMD continues to not satisfy demand all year it will cause significant negative consequences for the long term thesis even though the revenue and profit keep growing.  AMD has to gain as much share as possible while Intel and nVidia are not in a position to strongly defend their turf.  This shows a weakness in AMD's future.  In the past nVidia booked wafers (shoving out tons of low end GPUs) to starve AMD when demand exceeded their supply.  Now both Intel and nVidia could use their market power to squeeze out AMD's supply of substrates.\n\nI've seen this story play out multiple times before.  AMD has winning products but through either lack of foresight or resources failed to plan production levels sufficient to supply demand.  When that has happened it has never ended well for AMD.", "Those 2 things don\u2019t really conflict.  The limiting factors are wafers/substrates and possibly other components.  But the reason this is a limit is because of projections due to seasonal demand.  Remember wafer bookings needs to be done well in advance, especially for the latest nodes.  So let\u2019s say in 2018-19, TSMC asks AMD how many 7nm wafers they will need for 2021.  AMD will make those projections based on their roadmap and seasonal demand so it would make sense that they would book less wafers in 1st half of 2021 compare with 2nd half (as Su said AMD is second half weight).  It is just that COVID (and intel dropping the ball) has made demand much higher which naturally means some of the unmet 2020 Q4 demand has spilled over to 2021.", "I laughed at this, until I rememberd both my AMD motherboards are Gigabyte.", "XMG Neo 17 is one of those Tongfang with AMD chassis.

About pci, not only that but Cezanne has 8x lanes as Renoir, XMG admitted.

You have a 6 core chiplet and an 8 core chiplet. For the 5900x and the 5950x they get 2 chiplets, then if they don't make the cut in testing apparently AMD is disabling one chiplet and selling them as 5600x or 5800x. I'm sure they have 8 (or 16 for that matter) core CPU's that can't pass the required testing to earn the 5800x title, next in line would possibly be a 5700 at this point.

AMD is contracting with TSMC for their new generation of product. Nvidia is contracting with Samsung. Samsung's process is brand new and has been having a huge amount of wafer failures. It's very likely the reason the 3060 Ti exists is because it's the same die as the 3070, but it didn't pass QC. AMD, on the other hand, is using TSMC's 7nm process, which is capacity constrained at the moment because AMD's new Ryzen CPUs are also being manufactured with the process. There's only so much production capacity with these materials, and adding production capacity is an investment of literally billions of dollars, and literally takes years to do (source: I work in semiconductor supply chain). \n\n&gt; They can sell what they want at whatever price they want\n\nAgain - you don't know what you're talking about. Nvidia and AMD have contract rates to the different graphics card manufacturers. MSI, Asus, Gigabyte, etc, they all buy from Nvidia and AMD at pre-negotiated rates on *VERY* air-tight contracts. Nvidia and AMD are happy in that they can sell every chip they can make, but they aren't making additional money on these items just because the market price is inflated. And even then - the graphics card makers sell their products at pre-negotiated contract rates (though that actually is increasing due to new tariffs going into effect, but that's only passing the tariff onto the consumer.

As long as it's set up correctly, it has minimal impact on system performance since the encoder is separate silicon from the rest of the GPU's processing.

Try going for either Western Digital Black or Seagate Compute Drives.

If not, I'd recommend one of the MSI boards. You might've had a good experience with your Asus motherboard, but I tend see a lot of people online having trouble with Asus hardware. My Asus laptop is also pretty much the worst I've ever had in terms of reliability, so as far as I'm concerned Asus=junk.\n\nB) It's a very powerful chip so you don't need to overclock it if it does all you need. It should run fine stock, however my 1600AF was unstable and hot at default settings. I don't know if AMD fixed this in the Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series, but the Auto settings for me have been very bad with very high voltage causing high temps. My 1600AF was not stable until I undervolted it and decided to apply a decent overclock(got a decent tower cooler so why not?).\nOverall it should work fine out-of-the-box, but if you notice high temps and high voltages, it's likely the Auto voltage and clock speed algorythms shitting the bed.", "Just use Mesa, for OpenGL there isn't even a comparison and for Vulkan, while AMDVLK is also good and can be better for some games, just go for RADV for now...\n\nI might be mistaken but this should be all you need to do, before switching cards: `sudo pacman -S mesa lib32-mesa vulkan-radeon lib32-vulkan-radeon libva-mesa-driver lib32-libva-mesa-driver linux-latest linux-latest-headers`\n\nYou may also want to look into whether or not the Nvidia driver has installed some sort of X config and delete that.\n\nYou should probably also just look on the manjaro forums, there gotta be enough people switching GPUs from proprietary to free drivers that there is some sort of tutorial", "There has been so much bitching about \"driver bloat\" on this sub that AMD might have decided to skip a year.\n\nI don't really get the argument, if you want a lean driver you can just install the display driver.

The CPU can, depending on what you're trying to run, at what resolution, and a host of other factors. \n\n&gt; I am planning to use an i5 9400f\n\nIt's OK. Depends on the price when you grab it. On PCPP in the US, an i5 10400F runs about $20 more than the 9400F, and a B460 motherboard runs like $10 more.

AMD is faster, but not $80 worth faster.", "First the easy question- a GBA emulator will work on literally any computer you can find in Best Buy today. A $40 Raspberry Pi will work just fine.\n\nAt the risk of being annoyingly long winded, I want to try to answer your other questions as well. \n\nRegarding CPUs, when Intel introduced the i3, i5, i7 line, they oversimplified things to the point that they're actually more confusing now. \n\nThere are 11 generations of i-series processors, and every generation gets at least marginally faster. There's a $300 laptop at Walmart right now with an \"i7\" CPU, but it's slower than the current gen i3 models. (see: [https://www.walmart.com/ip/EVOO-15-6-FHD-Ultra-Thin-Notebook-Intel-Core-i7-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Blue/485370791](https://www.walmart.com/ip/EVOO-15-6-FHD-Ultra-Thin-Notebook-Intel-Core-i7-8GB-RAM-256GB-SSD-Windows-10-Home-Blue/485370791)). As a rule of thumb, an Intel CPU will drop in relative performance to the next \"i\" level about every two generations. So a 9th gen i7 is roughly equivalent to an 11th gen i5. \n\nTo make things a little more confusing, there are still 8th-11th gen Intel CPUs in laptops on the shelf at Best Buy, AND even within the same generation, you have higher and lower powered variations. \n\nAnyway, my point with all of this is, if you're looking for an \"i7\", you're doing it wrong. If some nerd told you to look for an i7, he either doesn't know what he's talking about or he didn't feel like you would understand.\n\nAs for Intel vs. AMD, in recent generations, the Ryzens have typically outperformed their Intel counterparts. Just so you're aligned, Ryzen 3 = i3, Ryzen 5 = i5, Ryzen 7 = i7. As for generations, 1st gen Ryzen (Ryzen 3 1200, for example) is roughly in line with 8th gen Intel (core i3- 8xxx). 2nd Gen Ryzen = 9th Gen Intel, 3rd Gen = 10th, and so on.\n\nAs for brands, IMO they are all pretty equal. HP has a billion 2-in-1's, and they're all called something or other (Pavilion, Envy, Spectre, etc.)  x360. Lenovo has a bunch as well. Some are called \"Flex\", but they also have plain Yogas and use \"Yoga\" to modify Thinkpad. \n\nAnyway, based on your use case, I think I would go with one of these options below.

They've invested literally billions of dollars into R&amp;D on these things. Investments that aren't seeing returns unless they can move units. \n\nAnd a lot of folks assume that when GPU prices are high, Nvidia and/or AMD are raking in extra money. In truth, they aren't making a dime extra. They sell their GPU silicon to board partners at pre-negotiated, contract rates. Those board partners then sell the completed cards to pre-builders and/or distributors for pre-negotiated, contract rates. The only people that make extra money from high GPU prices are scalpers and/or vendors if they decide to raise prices. \n\nAdditionally, AMD/Nvidia don't even physically make the items. Samsung currently makes Nvidia's offerings, and TSMC makes AMD's. Both are running at max capacity and are not able to keep up with demand. And adding capacity takes years and literally billions of dollars, so it's not like they can simply add more production capacity. \n\nIt really sucks that we're in the situation we're in, but it's simply the only way it can be.

That comment might have been a little bit too deep of a dive - just get \"normal\" DDR4 RAM and you'll be fine.\n\nAs for the amount of RAM, most people currently recommend 16GB of RAM for gaming builds. The \"default choice\" for this would be 2x8GB, so 2 sticks of 8GB each. 4x4GB will also work, but it's more expensive usually. Do not get a single RAM stick (1x16 or 1x8) if  you can avoid it! Safest choice is just 2x8GB.\n\nFor an AMD Ryzen CPU, the RAM speed also matters a lot, so be sure to get at the very least DDR4-3000 RAM, 3200 or even 3600 would be even better. Above 3600 MHz RAM is usually too expensive to be worth it.", "Well get a M1 MacBook Pro, get a virtual machine with windows: be faster than most other laptops.

From those you have to transfer that heat to the nickel plated copper heatspreader via solder and then to the cooler via thermal paste or liquid metal.\n\nThere is no way to absorb that heat fast enough from such a small heat producer trough 3 layers of stuff. (solder, heatspreder, tim) And this is harder when the load is on \"one small point\" from a single die. Also you cpu heatspreader is not made to perfection. A slight bend or dip will have to \"use\" more thermal paste which in turn will reduce the heat transfer by a small bit. Same goes for cooler and for the cpu dies itself.\n\nOpen prime95 and run small fft for 10 min. After the first min reset the temp monitoring and check again after 10 min. You will see you cpu will stay lower in temps.\n\nAfter that open chrome and watch the max cpu temp. You will get a higher max temp than prime, but this not mean that the chip uses the same power, it is just unable to dissipate that heat quick enough.\n\nThis happens in all chips in every application, but the algorithm that temp is reported is different. AMD reports multiple times per second to software, maybe others add a buffer to the low level code and report an average of the last 5 seconds to the software, so you will see lower temps, but in reality it is the same\n\nFor comparison, I have an old VW Polo.

The density would be so much lower that the 40CU midrange chips would end up being nearly as expensive to make as the 80CU parts on 7nm. They would also clock lower and use more power.  \n3. AMD has at least 3 different IO die variants and chipsets in active production on GF's 14/12nm process.

However, if the diagnosis proves only the GPU is at fault, I can probably go for a new 3070 that is in stock now and forgo freesync like I am doing now.", "If TSMC capacity is indeed the main issue with GPUs, which from what I've read it not necessarily is ([see this article](https://www.igorslab.de/en/more-details-and-backgrounds-on-the-scarcity-why-graphic-cards-are-so-hard-to-buy-and-manufacture/)) and GlobalFoundries 12LP+ has enough free capacity to compensate, which again, isn't a trivial assumption, then yes, it would make some sense to try to use it.\n\nFor the last part, it's not clear to me at all what quantities GF can supply. TSMC keeps expanding its production lines. It's entirely possible that TSMC's added capacity is more than GF can add.\n\nEven if GF can help, then, like others have said, this requires quite a bit of work. It's not a stop-gap solution. Work will have to go into the design, and money (quite a bit of it) will have to go into purchasing the software for such designs. Then it's up to AMD to decide if that expenditure is worth it and will bear fruit, considering the time to market.\n\nIf anything, it seems to me that it makes more sense to produce CPUs at GF. CPUs are more standalone, less feature-dependent (such as ray tracing or DLSS for GPUs) and tend to offer less of a generational leap. AMD is still selling 14nm and even 28nm CPUs. Backporting more modern designs to 12LP+ could potentially result in decent chips.\n\nAgain, AMD will need to decide that the effort is worth it.\n\nIt's worth noting that AMD still has an agreement to buy wafers from GlobalFoundries until 2024, and while AMD still has enough stuff to produce there, it's entirely possible that AMD will retire some products and replace them with new products.", "Weren't they refreshed like 3 months ago?

I can't emphasize enough how important DC is to AMD because of its margins and its annuity-ish nature. It's the largest factor in AMD's valuation. Note that datacenter talk was the only thing perking up AMD's AH stock price when Su was able to give a more positive, detailed answer on DC growth. \n\nI think that in prior years, they were discounting EPYC heavily to gain a beach head. That's why we got market share growth but much less revenue growth and margin impact. They've been careful to shield EPYC sales from scrutiny by mixing it with custom.

They don't want the narrative of what was bound to be a hard slog to get in the way of adoption.\n\nEPYC is why I'm so excited for 2021. I think this is EPYC's year with Rome and Milan to start to be a major impact on the financial statement for the whole fiscal year.

What is the CPU usage like when you're hitting those temps? CPU should only be getting to around 80C if you're close to 100% usage.", "Not many, but in like, 3 or 4 ways maybe. \n\nBut again, that's not the narrative you get from a huge number of people on this sub. The narrative you get is \"AMD is superior in every way for gaming on Linux, and you should never get Nvidia, and Nvidia performs worse than AMD on Linux.\" Which is objectively false in every sense. \n\nOn the whole, Nvidia performs better than AMD on Linux (Because on the whole, Nvidia has better cards than AMD, but that's decreasing). On the whole, an Nvidia card that's 7% faster than a specific AMD card on Windows will also be around 7% faster than that same card on Linux. And vice versa. \n\nSo unless someone cares greatly about Wayland, VR, CUDA, NVENC, or Ray Tracing, you should just get whatever the best performing card is in your price range, regardless of whether it's AMD or Nvidia.", "Beyond benchmarks, I think it comes down to a few things for me. \n\n* One of my main concerns is wayland, while xorg will always be an option and NVIDIA is working on dma-buf solution, I'd rather not be a second class citizen in this regard. Hopefully this goes smoothly but NVIDIA has wasted a lot of time trying to push EGLStreams now switching to DMA-BUF. We'll see how it all shapes up.\n* One thing I didn't like about NVIDIA was both my Adaptive Sync monitors always got this problem of the screen blanking off and back on. This happens when the frame rate drops below the adaptive sync range or there was some kind of slight stutter (as you may get when playing a game in Proton/WINE). And no amount of editing the range in the monitor's EDID will fix it. And one monitor is certified as G-SYNC compatible. I even bought an expensive DP cable. Since switching to AMD I haven't encountered this issue. However its hard to tell if Adaptive sync is enabled even though its reported enabled in Xorg.0.log and xrandr. But I haven't encountered any screen tearing. This isn't just a problem on Linux but Windows users on NVIDA also have this flickering/screen blanking problem. But I don't care what happens on Windows and it seems like NVIDIA's low framerate compensation doesn't work properly.\n* Potentially better Cyberpunk compatibility as Valve added an extension. Possibly this could be a trend going forward.\n* I own a Valve Index and AMD GPUs support Async Reprojection and NVIDIA GPUs don't.\n\nAt any rate, some people won't care about any of this and NVIDIA works fine for them. And that was me for a long time but this was the right time for me to switch.", "I bought new parts in 1 go (for a Ryzen 2700 build) during a major Newegg sale in 2019 July, except for a GPU (1050Ti) which I carried over.

I haven't been excited about their GPUs and probably won't be for a while, but I'm hoping they do MCM (multichip module) w/GPUs and hopefully that can bring prices down (especially for lower-end) at least until they get a foothold. Particularly when shortages aren't an issue anymore.\n\nI mean I'm fine with what I have and am broke so upgrades do have to be extremely compelling \n\n&gt;! note that before Ryzen, I was using an i7-860 system... really old, so the upgrade was a doubling of performance (significantly more w/multithreading) not even counting other niceties", "I would expect Nvidia to have much better support on Windows than AMD, especially with OpenGL.; the Ti is also the more powerful card, so if you're mostly going to play on Windows it would make sense to use it for that.

You get the benefits of being able to use Windows for some games, but you don't have to dual boot, and you don't have to run Windows on bare metal. That's the setup I have, with my 5800X and RTX 3090. I have a single-GPU passthrough VM where I pass through the 3090, 16GB of RAM (I have 32GB total), and 12 threads (6 cores), so basically my VM has equivalent performance to a bare metal machine with a 5600X and RTX 3090. But since all the games I play except one work on Linux, I use Linux for everything else, and only launch the VM when I want to play Apex. \n\nHowever, if they're BattlEye, you can't use a VM, regardless of whether you do dual or single GPU passthrough, as you will get kicked because BattlEye banned VMs. \n\nRX 580s suffer from the AMD reset bug which is a pain in the ass to work around, and it prevents you from being able to launch the VM twice in one boot, you have to reboot every time you want to launch the VM, which defeats the purpose. \n\nBut honestly, if I were you I would sell the 1080 Ti and the 580 both and get a 3080 instead.

Nvidia actually contributes FAR more work and money to open-source than AMD does, AMD just happens to include their Linux drivers in their FOSS work. Nvidia does not. But AMD is just as greedy a company and just as shady as Nvidia, neither one of them is better than the other. Same with Intel. But if you wanted to look at which company actually contributes more (both labor and money) to FOSS projects, Nvidia does MUCH more than AMD. AMD has like 8 or 9 Linux devs. And Nvidia was a gold sponsor of the Xorg developer's conference 2020, AMD was only Silver (or lower, I don't remember but I know they were at least one level below Nvidia and I think it was 2 levels).", "Enjoy!

And so AMD would be useless to me, along with the games AMD has issues with. Also, I don't trust AMD. It will take more than a good few years of \"hey we do open source drivers!!!1111\" to convince me.\n\nAlso, Linus said \"fuck you, Nvidia\" and every AMD Fanboi also said \"fuck you, Nvidia\" without understanding WHY Linus said what he said.

As in, you can use open source drivers to support features that you care about, even if the company in question doesn't want to go out of it's way to support them.\n\nFor instance, Gallium Nine. Not because it has amazing performance benefits or anything, but because you're *able to*, in a purely practical sense, add stuff to the driver.\n\nYou can talk about Wayland, but you're missing the point here: GBM is just *the present*. In a very practical sense, having open source drivers gives the community options to add things that AMD/Nvidia either doesn't care about or would rather not add. \n\nI could talk about firmware, but there's one problem: I'm not Richard M Stallman.

On the one hand since I now use Linux I'd like to support AMD's Linux support. On the other, I me around with AI stuff and the tensor cores in the Nvidia GPU's speed that up a lot. Also, I've never had any problems with my 980m in Linux.", "...why switch to inferior hardware?

Navi 1 was an unmitigated disaster, and is STILL unusable for huge numbers of people on Linux. RDNA 2 was hailed as miraculous by the community because ***most*** people could get the cards to ***mostly*** work at launch if they used the latest master repos for linux-firmware, mesa, and the kernel itself. Which is sad, considering Nvidia always, no matter what, has full, complete support for ALL new GPUs **prior** to launch. \n\nAnd then you have the fact that the voltage/current/power reading capabilities for AMD CPUs are now being removed from the kernel because AMD **refuses** to provide adequate documentation to the kernel devs in order to implement it properly. This is something that wouldn't even require any work or money on AMD's part, and they STILL refuse to do it. And with the GPU team it's even worse, it's like pulling teeth to get them to address bug reports, and there are numerous bug report threads with dozens (or hundreds) of affected users STILL experiencing **system-breaking** bugs, and there hasn't been a comment from an AMD driver dev in several months. I saw a shitload of people in those threads (because I was one of the afflicted users) flat-out say \"this response from AMD is some of the worst I've ever seen, and I'm gonna have to switch to Nvidia\" and actually followed through with the switch after only ever using AMD prior to that experience. Hell, that's what happened to me, too. I ONLY ever used AMD for CPU **and** GPU, but after the RDNA 1 experience, with two separate cards, and seeing everything I saw, I'll be goddamned if I buy another AMD GPU until I see that shit's changed.

Look through intel\u2019s 10th gen line and find a cpu that fits your budget but meets your needs. i5 9600k is also a solid one but from the 9th gen.\n\nGPU: The 3000 series at MSRP was insane power for your money, but these are now priced up and difficult to find in stock. The 1660super is great value and good power. I don\u2019t recommend buying any of the 2000 series GPUs at your budget.\n\nRAM: DDR3 is outdated, everything you\u2019ll find now is DDR4. Intel isn\u2019t huge on speed, so 32GB of 3000+ MHz should be more than enough. RAM prices also are pretty low right now. \n\nMotherboard: Just look through recommendations of boards that work for your CPU and have all the gadgets you want. I went with the MSI MPG Z490 myself.\n\nI also recommend messing around on https://www.userbenchmark.com. They take results from real PC tests to rank every CPU, GPU, RAM, etc against each other based on cost, value, performance, and more. There\u2019s also a comparison feature where you can pit two components against each other side by side.

You state one of the reasons.\n\n- AMD's contract isn't to continue production of 12nm I/O dies, but to use the GF processes. It's also continuing to produce Picasso and Dali there, for example, which are sold in Chromebooks and other products. It could produce other things, potentially. Although the global agreement is until 2024, the current terms are up to 2021, so AMD will be re-negotiating it anyway. It's an interesting question if AMD will do anything new at GF, but I don't think it's a real obstacle to anything.\n\n- According to the leaked roadmap, Rembrandt is DDR5/LPDDR5, so indeed no DDR4. I haven't seen anything to suggest that Warhol will be DDR4 (if you did, let me know), but it's possible that it will be. I don't know what Warhol will be, but it's possible that it's just enabling some stuff in Vermeer because Vermeer was rushed, kind of like Lucienne is for Renoir. As for AM4, I still expect Cezanne to be released for it at some point.\n\n- Far as I understand, RDNA/RDNA2 are based on N7, not N7P. Rembrandt is rumoured (that leaked roadmap) to use N6. Raphael (next gen desktop CPU) is expected to use 5nm. Warhol is expected to be 7nm.\n\n- LPDDR5 is already available and used in phones, so I see no problem releasing a mobile chip without DDR4 support. I'd expect Rembrandt to follow AMD's normal mobile cycle, so Q1. Intel is expected to release Alder Lake in September, and that should include DDR5 support.\n\n- I don't think there's much to learn from AM2+. The market is different these days, and although it's possible that there will be transitional products (perhaps Alder Lake will be like that), we've already seen AMD release only higher end products with the 5000 family, and I think it's possible that we'll see a new DDR5 high end platform while AM4 will be the lower cost platform, with older gen Zen cores, until the DDR5 ecosystem settles.\n\nEdit: Looking at your profile, I see that the only previous post you made is of a roadmap of sorts, without any real backing of the predictions, and which seems a little iffy (for example, Cezanne is said to have PCIe 4). It will be interesting to know how you came to some conclusions (like Warhol being 5nm).\n\nRegarding Warhol, if it's indeed a DDR4/DDR5 product, then my guess is that it will ship with two different I/O dies rather than a single one for both.", "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u3001\u30ed\u30fc\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30fb\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3084\u4ed6\u306e\u88fd\u54c1\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\uff08\u30b6\u30a4\u30ea\u30f3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u8cb7\u53ce\u304c\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u5834\u5408\u306b\u306f\u3001APU\u3084FPGA\u306e\u751f\u7523\u306a\u3069\uff09\u306e\u4ee3\u66ff\u54c1\u3068\u3057\u3066\u3001\u30b5\u30e0\u30b9\u30f3\u306e8nm\u307e\u305f\u306f\u305d\u308c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u88fd\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u6d3b\u7528\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u8a08\u753b\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \u3053\u306e\u60c5\u5831\u306f\u5927\u76ee\u306b\u898b\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u3002\u3057\u304b\u3057\u3001AMD\u304c\u91cd\u8981\u5ea6\u306e\u4f4e\u3044\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30cd\u30f3\u30c8\u3092\u30d1\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u4f4e\u3044\uff08\u3064\u307e\u308a\u8981\u6c42\u5ea6\u306e\u4f4e\u3044\uff09\u88fd\u9020\u30d7\u30ed\u30bb\u30b9\u306b\u5916\u6ce8\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3001\u751f\u7523\u6027\u3092\u3055\u3089\u306b\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3055\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306a\u304f\u3001\u53ce\u76ca\u6e90\u3067\u3042\u308b\u9700\u8981\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u610f\u5473\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3068\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\n\u6d41\u901a\u91cf\u3055\u3048\u5897\u3048\u305f\u3089\u3069\u3053\u3067\u4f5c\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3051\u3069\u3001\u6027\u80fd/\u30ef\u30c3\u30d1\u304c\u3042\u304b\u3089\u3055\u307e\u306b\u4e0b\u304c\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u52d8\u5f01", "Debt doesn't necessarily need to be used on stock buy backs, but rather anything the company wants.

Currently with the 10850k at 350$ intel is the obvious choice. AMDs closest competitor is the 3700x and that has 2 less cores and has much worse single core. Zen 3 is overpriced except for the Ryzen 9s because if you want the best you have to pay up. Intel is seen as unsexy because people are a hive mind and like to root for AMD like they are their friend when they are company that the moment has the public advantage starts selling 6 core cpus for 300$.

That is Intel frequently had overclocking blocks or limitations in overclocking and still do on most of their chips while the majority of AMD chips throughout again their history have been overclockable and at times unlockable.\n\nFrom in the deep ATi past you had cut down GPUS that could be unlocked and overclocked to offer astonishing value.

Their tests aren't conducted in realistic environments and they only give a seal of efficiency - which is kind null for a desktop PC these days. There's a list of Gold rated - quite expensive - PSUs that get trashed by Bronze ones. \n\nNow, for the question at hand. FSP vs CV, it's hard to say without going deeper into each model however my instinct is to go towards DC-DC. Group regulation these days is just a signal of older design, which Corsair CV does have since it's an upgraded (barely) Corsair VS. And the FSP does promise a nice set of protections.\n\nTake a gander at some EVGA alternatives where you are as well, EVGA BQ is quite good (also DC-DC). Furthermore, the 650W version of the Corsair CV is also DC-DC (similar to EVGA BQ is most respects), mayhaps it can be found at an agreeable price.\n\n&gt;What are the implications of said PSUs in a modern day gaming system (Ex. AMD Ryzen 5 3600 + AMD Radeon 5700 XT)?\n\nWell you already took the most important step, that is _not getting a piece of garbage_, so the major risks we warn against are out. Neither PSU listed will risk your system albeit I would tell anyone to avoid Corsair CV and VS if possible for they can generally be found at similar prices as better units, however, a budget is a budget, and I'm south america, I know how tough markets can get (if you'd like to send me link to a retailer I can check for alternatives as well).\n\nFurther implications may occur when it comes to idle states for CPUs. In such states modern CPUs will drop their core voltage quite low, and some group regulated PSUs on the lower end cannot maintain stability in its lines and does 'cause BSOD - a BSOD easily remedied by turning off a setting in the bios, but a bsod nonetheless.\n\nWhat all that said, it is a whole another story if one is considering serious overclocking, in which case a PSU with better regulations is recommended to avoid VRM stress.\n\n&gt;Will these things matter if I made a build made completely out of components from 5+ years ago ( before Intel introduced Haswell, ex. Intel i7-3770K + AMD Radeon HD 7970)?\n\nProbably not unless you plan to take the 3770k for a overclocking spin.", "I'd consider holding off on a GPU until the market is less insane or buy a used GPU. If prices were normal, that GPU would be a third of the price or you could get one 4x as good for that price. Right now, you could buy a used GPU like a 2060 Super or 5600 XT that is 3x as good for that much or a 1660 Super that's over 2x as good for ~$220-250. \n\nThe first list below has an integrated GPU that could get you by if you wait. \n\nThe second list is assuming you buy some GPU now and changes other parts to be less expensive or better performing. You don't need such an expensive mobo. One that's half the cost will perform just as well and have everything you need. The RAM is faster, the one you've selected is equivalent to DDR4-3200 CL16 and too often has issues reaching its rated speeds. The PSU you've selected is overkill for a 1050 ti or any lower power GPU.

Also, I feel there is no point in going in for an X570 Mobo because amd is going to drop the am4 socket after Zen 3, so years down the line, if you upgrade, you will have to change processor and the Mobo.\n\nYou can get 32gb (16x2 sticks) of ram in your budget.

But that does not seem to be the case, if leaks/rumours from Taiwan are true (the split being 30K wafers for AMD for Q4 2020, 120K for consoles- which is fine for console launch quarter, but way too much for them for next quarters).", "I would advise playing at resolutions where GPU becomes the bottleneck. So probably target something around 1440p. Get a second hand Intel or AMD platform then jump to am5 or Intel ddr5 platforms when they arrive. It should be 2021 end or early 2022. Zen 3 will be aging very fast and very badly when that happens, it will look silly and might depreciate faster than you think in the used market.\n\nOFC if you are getting a pc for work or productivity purposes, no point waiting. Ddr5 supply situation should be very healthy as the ram will hit mass production before both platforms.", "Not interesting to me but it will be nice to have a card occupying that price and performance point from AMD, providing that stock and pricing levels return to some semblance of normality at some point.", "Then I fail to see the reason for your post then..

You will need a real incentive to convince people to migrate to an entirely new platform. It's going to be something exciting. If AMD can't Intel will :)", "I made this build. Since you want to use for both gaming and 3D rendering, you'd need a processor with higher thread count. So I selected the 5800x. The motherboard, PSU and SSD are very well reviewed. I assumed you need a monitor in the budget so included a 27\" IPS, 144Hz monitor. The budged comes to 135k leaving about 35k for your GPU (3060Ti FE). If you don't want a monitor, you can go for 3080 FE GPU or save some on the monitor (Optix G241) and get a 3070 FE. All prices are current and available but you may be able to get better prices offline.

Since updating the BIOS I was able to play Apex and Hunt: Showdown without my PC crashing. Fingers crossed this was it all along.", "It's an issue with AMD graphics drivers from what I've heard. I recently built my PC with AMD parts and I'm having the exact same issue. The only solution for now is to revert to an older driver for your GPU or wait for AMD to fix the issue.", "That's a very good question. It made me refect on the current standing of players in Semi space.\n\nAMD primarily plays in the CPU/APU market and works on the x86 architecture. The other big player in the CPU market is Intel. But in teh broader definition of Semiconductor you have players like Samsung and SK hynix who are absolute behemoth in the memory market. Infineon, Renesas are titans of MCU. TI is leader when it comes to Analog.\n\nNow coming to the question - Why don't tech giants acquire AMD. Here's my take\n\n1. AMD's share price has increased multifold since the release of their new generation of Ryzen processors. This would mean that the acquiring company has to pay a premium to acquire the company.\n\n2. It would take a couple of years before the hardware and software get integrated completely. Even then, the processor is just one element; the acquiring company would still have to source other chips from other companies.\n\n3. Tech Giants are focussed on software rather than hardware, and it is a good thing. As consumers we get better software experience across multiple devices.\n\n4. Assuming Microsoft acquires AMD, it has to take a stand if it wants its software to run exclusively on AMD chips and the existing partnerships. If so, then they would be loosing a maor chunk of the market serviced by Intel. This would also cause massive outcry as customers with Intel chips would be worried about the software support; and considering many companies worldwide are invested in Intel based products would degrade MSFT's standing.\n\n5. By not acquiring AMD, MSFT can be architecture agnostic i.e. they can work on developing a version of Windows that would run on ARM chips. On the premise of ARM being better for mobile computing, it makes sense that MSFT doesn't latch on to only one architecture.\n\nSpeaking of competition, there is already a fierce competition in Semiconductor space, there is massive consolidation taking space. Every few months you can see that the companies are either getting acquired/merged. So, unless there is any breakthrough that would disrupt the semiconductor space, the consolidation will continue as most of the offerings are slowly becoming commodity products.", "Let me give an analogy - Lets say Mercedes Benz announces that they had an automation break through, and a new Mercedes Benz is now going 3D print cars which will cost half the price of a Honda Civic. The new 3D printed Mercedes will be just as good quality as the previous models that cost 2-3 times as much. \n\nHonda and the other car companies might decide that they need to stop making cars, and figure out how to obtain this new 3D printing machine to make their cars even cheaper. If they produce any cars, they will be losing money if they have to sell it for less than half price. \n\nA month later, every dealer ship sold out all the cars they have afraid of the new Mercedes Benz. No one can buy a new car, as Mercedes is about to destroy the market. Mercedes then announces that they will have 3 cars this weeks, but many more cars next week. The next week Mercedes then releases 5 cars. \n\n8 lucky people buy the new 3D printed Mercedes, and 4 sell it on eBay where it goes for double. \n\nWhen Mercedes spits out thousands of these a months, then other companies are in trouble. Right now, all the other companies got scared, so none are making cars. As a result if someone wants to buy a car, none are available. This causes the price of existing cars to skyrocket. \n\nThis is similar to graphics cards, except the same companies make both. When they release the 3050, 3050 Ti, 3060 (and the barely released 3060 Ti) - this destroys every graphics card from $100 - $500 on the market. The $500 3070 \"destroyed\" every graphics card from $500-$1,500. \n\nCompanies are scared to make the old graphics cards, because as soon as these new cards are available, their old cards are worthless. As a result, they're focusing on ramping up production for these new cards instead.  \n\nNow to answer your question, the 1650 Super is a 4GB 1660 (1660 is normally 6GB) and they're often about the same for gaming - the 1660 was usually a terrible choice. \n\nFor the past 2 weeks, everything has been sold out. A month ago there were some cards under $150 available; except for these everything else has been mostly sold out since December. I've tried ordering several 1650 Supers and have received emails saying they have been permanently discontinued. In a few months the RTX 3050 will come out for $150-$185 and probably beat most $200-$300 cards like the 1660. \n\nIf you can wait a few months, there's going to be good choices. Until then, your best bet is to buy a used 1050 Ti, 1060, etc. \n\nAs for the rest of your build. Intel and AMD traded places. Reviewers and YouTubers review products at launch, but prices change over time. \n\nThe i5-10600 used to be $180-190, and the Ryzen 3600 was $170 making it a much better choice. Today the i5 is $140 and the Ryzen 3600 is $200 - the i5 is a much better value option. \n\nThe Ryzen 3100 used to be $99 and the i3-10100 was $139 - the 3100 destroyed the i3. Today the Ryzen 3100 is $160-$190, and the i3 is $120 - Intel wins. The i3-10100F was released, it's supposed to be $90, but keeps selling out and trends at about $115-$125 as well. \n\nUnlike the Ryzen 3000 series CPUs, the Intel offers integrated graphics standard, the F CPUs don't have integrated graphics. The Ryzen 3000G CPUs with integrated graphics are actually Ryzen 2000 processors with graphics added. \n\nBasically AMD's top of the line beats Intel's, and AMD is now the premium choice. AMD embraces this and deliberately wants to charge more than Intel because $$$. \n\nIntel realized they can't make a better product than AMD, so instead they slashed their prices so they now have way better prices than AMD. \n\nThe i3-10100F or i3-10100 with a B560 motherboard would be the wisest choice."], "2021-02-21": ["I would go Nvidia for now, AMD has plans to catch up, but when no one knows.\n\nAlso go with 32GB RAM, that's way better for editing, effects etc.\n\nAnd of course a 6 core or better CPU", "\nAMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X\t\nNoctua NH-U14S-TR4\t\nASUS ZENITH II EXTREME ALPHA \t\nKSM32ED8/32ME, 32 GB ECC UDIMM at 3200 MHz\t\nStorage\t\t\t\t\n\tSystem\tSamsung 980 PRO 1TB\t\n\tData\tSeagate IronWolf ST8000VN004, 8TB\nNVIDIA GT1030-SL-2G-BRK, Vega FE\nThermaltake Core V71 TG\t\nCorsair RM850x", "This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

And then you skimp in basically any other pet of your system.\n\nIn 1080p, the performance of your CPU matters way more than in higher resolutions, so you definitely want a way better CPU. Your PSU should definitely be better, and your mainboard as well. My recommendation would be the following:\n\nCPU: AMD 5600X or 5800X\n\nMainboard: MSi B550 Tomahawk\n\nRAM: you want faster RAM. Minimum 3200 MHz CL16.\n\nCPU cooler: the Kraken is a Little on the overkill side of things, but it\u2018s great if you want it. A BeQuiet Dark Rock Pro 4 will do nicely as well.\n\nSSD: you want an NVMe drive. Kingston A2000, Western Digital SN550/ SN750 or Samsung 970 Evo.\n\nPower Supply: Corsair RMX, SeaSonic Focus GX, Super Flower Leadex III, Phanteks Amp, BitFenix Formula Gold, BitFenix Whisper M or BeQuiet Straight Power 11 (/platinum) with around 650 W.\n\nI would personally get a better case. E.g. a Lian Li Lancool Two or a BeQuiet 500DX.\n\nAnd now, the GPU. You\u2018re playing at 1920x1080, so I\u2018d never go over a 3070 or a Radeon 6800. Look at actually good deals.

You could look at the -PRO version if you want front panel USB-C or a B550 if future-proofing doesn't matter as much for you.\n\n- 3600 CL16 RAM, the sweet spot for Zen 3, as they say. 32 GB should be plenty for video editing. \n\n- 2 TB WD Blue SSD, M.2. I have one of these, too. Quick PCIe SSD, good for games and light video editing. You can add tons more storage in the future if you need.\n\n- Good luck getting a 3080.\n\n- Meshify C is a great looking case with good thermals, ~~it does have tempered glass but it's pretty lowkey all things considered (also you might be able to get tinted glass, not sure)~~ Nevermind, you can get it with regular glass, tinted, or solid.\n\n- Corsair RMx is a reliable PSU from what I've heard, you can probably get away with 750W but I'd up it to 850W for the 3080/future-proofing. 80+ efficiency, fully modular for cable management.\n\n**Peripherals**\n\n- Dell S2721DGF is a very good monitor. I assume you want to take advantage of the 3080 so I went with 1440p 165 Hz. If you want a bigger screen you can get the S3220DGF, which is 32' and VA (I have one, it's great).\n\n- Mouse + keyboard is going to be mostly personal preference. I don't like Logitech keyboards much but it looks like they're the only companies making decent wireless stuff nowadays. The Logitech G Pro is a pretty good mouse from what I've heard, battery lasts weeks.\n\n- 3 case fans, totally optional. The Meshify comes with 1 as back exhaust, and if you put your AIO on the top of the case you can add these 3 120mm fans to the front for some extra airflow for the 3080. Non-rgb to keep it low key.", "[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/XQpNj2)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/g94BD3/amd-ryzen-5-5600x-37-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100000065box) | Purchased For $0.00 \n**Motherboard** | [MSI B550-A PRO ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/7gxbt6/msi-b550-a-pro-atx-am4-motherboard-b550-a-pro) | $149.99 @ B&amp;H \n**Memory** | [OLOy 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3600 CL18 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/KV4BD3/oloy-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-md4u1636181chkda) | $139.99 @ Newegg \n**Storage** | [ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/kQZzK8/adata-xpg-sx8200-pro-2-tb-m2-2280-nvme-solid-state-drive-asx8200pnp-2tt-c) | $239.95 @ B&amp;H \n**Video Card** | [NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 10 GB Founders Edition Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/RnDkcf/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-10-gb-founders-edition-video-card-9001g1332530000) | $1000.00 \n**Case** | [Fractal Design Meshify C ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Y6Crxr/fractal-design-meshify-c-atx-mid-tower-case-fd-ca-mesh-c-bko-tg) | $94.99 @ Amazon \n**Power Supply** | [EVGA SuperNOVA GA 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/j6NgXL/evga-supernova-ga-850-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-220-ga-0850-x1) | $148.99 @ Newegg \n**Operating System** | [Microsoft Windows 10 Home OEM 64-bit](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wtgPxr/microsoft-os-kw900140) | $108.78 @ Other World Computing \n**Monitor** | [ViewSonic VX2768-2KPC-MHD 27.0\" 2560x1440 144 Hz Monitor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/ndZzK8/viewsonic-vx2768-2kpc-mhd-270-2560x1440-144-hz-monitor-vx2768-2kpc-mhd) | $259.99 @ B&amp;H \n**Keyboard** | [Velocifire VM02WS Wireless Standard Keyboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/hjfhP6/velocifire-vm02ws-wireless-standard-keyboard-vm02ws) | $59.99 @ Amazon \n**Mouse** | [Logitech MX MASTER 2S (Black) Wireless Laser Mouse](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/JKvZxr/logitech-mx-master-2s-black-wireless-laser-mouse-910-005131) | $59.80 @ Amazon \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | **Total** | **$2262.47**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2021-02-24 02:09 EST-0500 |\n\nBasically other guy's build but better in every possible way.

I mean, it has been around when that processor came out in 2012. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you go Intel or AMD. While Intel was the defacto standard for many years, AMD has come up with some serious competition now. The newest generation Zen processors work well for DAWs and offer a bit more performance for the money.\n\nPersonally, I don't look just for raw power. I look for low TDP, because that means I can use quieter cooling. My workstation runs an AMD Ryzen 7 3600 which runs very well for orchestral programming and general DAW work.", "For Ryzen.

Most DAW'S will keep the processing of each instrument to one core of the cpu. More cores will help you with multitracking an assload of instruments, but it's better to have fewer, faster cores than more, less speedy ones. In this department AMD just nudged out intel with their newest series, but rumors are that 11th gen intel parts will be back on top.\n\n2. Budget. In this case AMD wins hands down. They've used the same cpu socket for the past few generations of ryzen processors, so the parts have been out on the market for years, have a long use history, and can be picked up relatively cheaply, often used in great condition. I bought a ryzen 3600x and a 400 series motherboard, with the knowledge that I can upgrade to the next series of processor without having to rebuild the entire machine.\n\nIn either case, if you're upgrading to current gen or last gen components from a 3000 series cpu, your problems getting pro tools to run should all but disappear whether you go AMD or Intel.\n\nI just recently built a workstation from scratch for under \u20ac600, so if you need any advice on components I can send you a parts list\n\nEDIT: Here's the parts list from my completed build: https://pcpartpicker.com/b/Njk6Mp\n\nThat site is also super helpful if you're planning on building, it automatically checks compatibility of components!", "Yes and also you know that when amd announced that zen 3 will not be supported by B450 and x470 boards, community opened a war to AMD in such a magnitude they changed the plans. \n\nNoone did the same for intel they were even changing sockets for fun per generation.", "I think things go this way because Intel/Nvidia have been leader in their domain for quite some time, while AMD is kind of sort of a \"newcomer\" in the high end market for both, so people tend to let some things slip through (kind of like the \"ah, they're just a small indie video game company, cut them some slack\"). Except people tend to forget that AMD has claimed to be premium now, they're \"big boys\" so they should get the same treatment imo\n\nI'm saying this with an AMD CPU and almost went with an AMD GPU too", "Added the list as an edit to my previous comment! I'll add some tips and tricks below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're building from scratch, here are the important things:\n\n\\-Motherboard. Should have enough input and output to attach everything and avoid adapters/dongles/splits as much as possible, and it should have at least one M.2 slot, preferably 2, for a high speed SSD (more on that later) and/or a wireless network card. The ASRock B450M Pro4 is a popular budget one because it has 2 M.2 slots and 4 memory slots, and it's compatible with the latest Ryzen CPU's.\n\n\\-Processing power. I recommend the 3000 series AMD Ryzen CPU's if you're on a budget, because it's relatively easy to upgrade to the 5000 series down the line and you can wait for prices to normalize.\n\n\\-Quiet cooling. Get the biggest tower cooler and the quietest fans you can afford. My fans are spec'ed as running at 16 dB each, so 4 of them together run at around 22dB, which is essentially inaudible with the background noise level in my room (around 32 dB).\n\n\\-Dual channel or quad channel memory rated at 3200 mHz and latency around CL16. Quantity of memory isn't a huge deal, but populating all your memory slots is a good idea to reduce lag and latency. I started at 16gB and upgraded to 32gB to future-proof, if you're going orchestral then go up to 64 or even 128.\n\n\\-SSD, size and speed. Solid state storage is absolutely essential. It's gotten really cheap lately and is logarithmically faster than conventional spinning hard disks. I recommend at least a 512gB NVME SSD plugged into the aforementioned M.2 slot to hold your system and essential programs. 1tB would be even better. If you need additional storage a SATA 3 2.5 inch drive is a slightly slower, affordable option to hold project files and sample libraries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe not important things:\n\n\\-Graphics card. You basically only need a card that will let you see the images on your screen. If you're planning on running multiple monitors then multiple inputs is a consideration. If you plan on doing video editing as well then it's absolutely important, but then the rest of my recommendations would be different as well!\n\n\\-Case. Just make sure it holds all the pieces and doesn't rattle. I'd probably say you can just save the case from your previous machine. \n\n\\-Onboard sound card. You're definitely going to add an external interface, so onboard sound isn't a consideration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that helps!", "400-450$ perhaps. But in this market situation doesn't what AMD says, retailers are still gonna sell it for way high.", "My understanding of the Infinity fabric used by Ryzen is that the sweet spot is 3600 MHz. It's hard to get anything faster to work in a stable manner, and that speed is the maximum that allows the clocks for CPU and memory to be synchronized. I'd get the 3600 CL18 if the motherboard supported it.\n\nSome combinations of memory and board \\*might\\* allow overclocking but that's unlikely to happen if your board won't support 3600 MHz on four sticks, that indicates that 3600 on two sticks is very close to the edge.\n\nFor what it's worth, I have a R5 3600 with 32G at 3600 MHz CL16,  but my motherboard is different:\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Ensign\\_nemo/saved/#view=MKpQD3](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Ensign_nemo/saved/#view=MKpQD3)\n\nOne option is to buy two sticks of the same memory, and run it at a slower speed. You might be able to get a speed close to 3200 MHz doing that, but its a crapshoot, and you'll need to experiment a bit to see if it is stable.\n\nI also caution you that the QVLs for most motherboards are often months out of date, sometimes manufacturing processes improve and you can squeeze a bit more out of the hardware.\n\nThis page: [https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450%20Pro4/#MemoryMS](https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450%20Pro4/#MemoryMS) is the correct one for the Matisse family but only has three GSkill entries, that indicates that the data is not close to complete.\n\nThe chart at [https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450%20Pro4/#Specification](https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450%20Pro4/#Specification) shows that the Matisse family should support up to 2667 MHz for DR in four slots. Going with two DIMMs (DR in the chart) only boosts you to 3200 MHz.\n\nBTW, the memory that you gave is 32G 2400 MHz: [https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-32gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232550](https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-32gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232550)\n\nIs this what you intended to buy? If so, why not go up to 3200 MHz for two 16GB sticks?\n\nI'd just get two more 8GB sticks and run them at 2667 if you get a measly 533 MHz more if you use 2x16GB rather than 4x8GB. You might even be able to clock them a bit higher than 2667. Maybe.", "AMD GPU are excellent in performance and have great OC potential. If they can feed the supply demand it could hurt NVIDIA and I think this is the main zone where they make more to take the ground in budget zone.", "I mean, it's not as simple as \"no difference\". As things stand, AMD cpus have a significant advantage in multi-threaded workloads (obviously I am talking about high-end cpus here, but in terms of price to performance this holds true throughout the product range), and as of 5000 series (if you can find one) hold an advantage in single threaded workloads too.   \n\n\nSure, they run a tad hotter historically, but even that's not simple. For instance, the 3700x is a 65w cpu. 65w is 65w, no matter who makes it. It cannot produce more than 65w worth of heat. Ever. Many Intel CPUs actually run at higher TDPs, which means they will run hotter. The i7-10700K, a comparable unit to the 3700x, runs at a 125w TDP, meaning it can run more than twice as hot, and has similar or lower multi-threaded scores (and slightly higher single-threaded) than the 3700x. It's also far more expensive.   \n\n\nAs it stands, it is extraordinarily difficult to reccomend an Intel CPU. They are far more expensive, have the same or worse performance (especially multithreaded - useful for stuff like audio editing), and don't offer any other advantages to make up for their downsides. This will likely change with the 11th gen release later this year, but if you're building today, AMD every time.", "One day AMD will dominate what Intel used to do and PCMR will be angry at AMD and Intel will become the supportive PC Hardware. Then PCMR will split into hate groups AMD and Intel while agreeing one thing Nvidia makes good GPUs and are highly sought after in the market. \n\n----\n\nEven as a AMD Threadripper user I can agree that Nvidia's GPU are superior to AMD's GPUs and Intel's fanboys will agree the same. But, to pick which GPU manufacturer is best there will be a bitter debate that the only way for us to win to go to war with one another and we will win that war Intel fanboys. /sarcasm\n\n----\n\nSeriously all that matters is your budget and what you're going to do with your PC if it's workstation Intel CPUs are better while AMD's CPUs are great for intense workload.

Sure its faster but if your GPU is the bottleneck then you'll gain nothing for much more money.\n\nThe 10400 with non-Z board and 2666 ram is on par with stock r5 3600 with 3200ram. Also a little extra, the 10400 runs much cooler than the 3600 so you get lower noise levels on top.\n\nNeither platform will get you much future proofing right now, so i wouldn't worry about that.

AMD doesn't need to release something slightly above 5700XT performance. Which would indicate where the 6700 non-XT would have been.

For AMD/Nvidia, that's long before release - it's before the specs for GA106 were even first rumoured.\n\nNo, the real reason is more likely there's just *no need to*. Yields are good enough that the vast majority of Navi22 dies can be used for the 6700XT, so why bother even trying to allocate dies for lower end products when you know you're going to have an incredibly difficult time meeting demand for one SKU?", "I don't comment here often. I mainly lurk, but I'm thinking Intel has all the ducks lined up. \n\nThough their fabs are behind TSMC (and probably on par with Samsung, approximately) they WILL get their process sorted, and unlike 20+ years ago, they'll make headway in the gpu space. \n\nThe new integrated igp is promising for their future stand alone gpus. \n\nThe real danger is in amds increasing server share.\n\nNvidia isn't competition.

Intel certainly can, and will likely do their own infinity fabric. \n\nIntel's problem is that they don't have enough capacity. But they will. \n\nI don't have a position in Intel, but I'm thinking about it.\n\nGlobal foundries would be another interesting company. But they aren't publicly traded.

Of you look at performance, they are neck and neck with amd beating Intel buy 2-3% on some benchmark. For gaming Intel arguably still had the best bang for your buck.\n\n2. All this all well and good that amd latest chips are pretty much equal with Intel except you can't buy them!  There is a massive chip shortage so guess what, you don't have to sell the latest greatest chip , most people just want a reasonably fast chip that isn't sold out and Intel can deliver.\n\nThe chip shortage really came in Intel's favor, they can continue selling their current chips and they will sell (can't buy and) and this gives them time to fix thier manufacturing mess.", "Not sure if BIOS mods are entirely necessary on the kawpow algo, but it may be worth a look.

So don't worry.\n\nAs for ECC, here's the deal; It's job is to make sure the bits written to the RAM don't corrupt, before they're offloaded to the Hard Drive.\n\nWithout it, you have no reassurance that the data in RAM stayed 'pure'.\n\nFor backups, this can be a big deal. For Multimedia, usually not; since a single corrupted bit or two will be unnoticeable in most media files, but could corrupt your backup.\n\nThe trick to using desktop RAM, is to remember that microchips DO have little tiny physically moving parts (called gates), that flip between 1's and 0's. So you want to ensure these gates are switched with maximum confidence.\n\nAs such, normally you'd set a dram voltage, of 1 step higher than default (whatever your motherboard allows as the minimum voltage add), and then knock all your ram timings down by 1 step also; electricity does have a rise, fall, and settle time; so by slowing the whole thing down a bit, you ensure any gates that flip are 'fully closed' and any errant voltage has settled, before writing the next bit.\n\nIt's still not any sort of guarantee, it's just a level of nerd safeguard.\n\n&gt;How would I get a VPN (NordVPN) to work?

So if I have a container for qBittorrent, could I have another VPN container that could connect to the qBittorrent container?\n\u200b\nNordVPN is a monster of a tool, the fact that they route their business clients THROUGH your connection results in some very strange network activity.\n\nRegardless though, if you've done your research and Nord is fit for purpose for you, then so be it.\n\nYes, there's a LOT of ways to get a VPN to work with certain tools, but the easiest mistake-proof, noob-friendly way, is to just spin up a light weight Virtual Machine on your server, and have that entire machine connect to the VPN, 24/7.\n\nBlock all ports except the VPN port, so there's no risk of data spill, and you're 'safe'.\n\n--- \n\nThe only other comment I have, is to look into SnapRaid, on Ubuntu Desktop; rather than UnRaid, if it's mostly media content.\n\nNot only is it a free solution, but it checksums your data, which UnRaid doesn't do.\n\nIf a file corrupts on UnRaid, plugins can tell you about it, but not actually do anything. It's YOUR job to go and replace your corrupted data from a known safe backup.\n\nSnapRaid has the down side, of being not real-time; it only updates its protection whenever you set (say, nightly), so your 'new data' can be vulnerable for a day. However, it can scan and repair corrupted files.\n\nIt's not ideal if you're running a business off a NAS or such, but if you're storing media, it's far more ideal.\n\nSomeone like LinusMediaGroup are big fans of unraid, because media can handle some corruption, they can 'fix it in post', and they have a full backup at all times; but even they have moved most of their systems to ZFS; they just tell you about it in server blogs, rather than in big grand videos like they did with the UnRaid series.\n\nHome users are usually WAY more lax about keeping perfect backups, and verifying their backups were correct, so keeping the data safe on disk *really* should be a priority.", "Do you like Semiconductors?

So if Premier Pro is a main focus for you, the 10700K is the pick.\n\nNow if you use both program equally, I think you need to step up to the max of your budget for an Intel i9-10850K. The 10850K is a 10900K with ever so slightly slower speeds (only .1 GHz). It balances the need for high single core speed in Photoshop, while having 10 cores to increase performance in Premier Pro. The processor is $410 USD right now, and it's price should drop since Intel is releasing it's 11th Gen CPUs at the end of the month.\n\nNow I said $50 more for the 5800X since the 5800X has greater single core performance while matching the 10900K in multiple CPU performance, even though the 5800X has 8 cores.", "As someone who's been running systems from both teams since the AMD FX days, and then onto Ryzen while also running the chronologically equivalent Intel rigs in parallel, I can say that AMD offering have improved considerably.\n\nWhat remains as a bit of an issue with AMD is RAM compatibility, but even this is mostly a non-issue.  What happens most often is that the generic XMP profile isn't stable, but a little time spent in BIOS tuning the RAM manually resolves things.\n\nThe other big difference is overclocking is very different with Ryzen.  It's not the simple matter of dialing in the clock, then upping Voltage to achieve stability.  Ryzens do a pretty good job of overclocking themselves, and because they're unable to hit the same clocks as Intel's chips, they can be a little *boring* to an overclocker.  Overclocking is still possible, but not to the exciting *high numbers* you can achieve with Intel.  Even so, the clocks are irrelevant now, due to AMD's excellent IPC.\n\nThat's just a very general compare and contrast of the two platforms.  Most of your Intel will translate well to building an AMD system, but just keep in mind RAM may give you a bit of a puzzle to solve, and that chasing high clock frequencies isn't quite as exciting with AMD as it is with Intel.\n\nCheers.", "You need to use DDU to delete your old drivers, also run it again to delete AMD drivers if your old one was nvidia.

Have you considered that MANY CAD/Architecture programmes are optimised for intel, overturning any advantage? Check out puget systems deep dives, even now intel sometimes still trumps amd in specific workloads, or else a i5-10400 at like $140 is still WAY better value than a Ryzen 3600 at $180+ especially wehen you consider the lack of need for a dedicated GPU\n\nI watch benchmarks. I am not somebody who works with these programs so I can't say if they are optimised for Intel or AMD. They are at almost the same price, considering the motherboards, so 3600 has an edge in multicore, which is 3d modelling and rendering, while 10400 is better in single core, which is CAD and games.

And with Broadcast the RTX voice capabilities are amazing, and I rarely have an issue with drivers. I also have a mixed g-sync and freesync setup and both displays work great with both enabled at once. What features are you missing from AMD? Or do you just mean the UI?

It's also a lot more bearable when a 3090 is going in a system that probably has a high end CPU cooler and tons of other cooling mitigations, not relatively basic tower with a low end CPU cooler as most GTX 970s and R9 390s were being slapped into. \n\nYou're also massively underestimating how much power AMD's 6800 and up are using, because Nvidia's ain't much higher:\n\nhttps://tpucdn.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt/images/power-gaming-peak.png\n\nThat and also people get usable raytracing, a proper video encoder, DLSS, etc. Considering MSRPs (given the state of things), honestly I don't think AMD's value is all that great this generation thus far:\n\nhttps://tpucdn.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt/images/relative-performance_3840-2160.png\n\nThe 6800 XT is priced $50 lower than the RTX 3080, lacks all the features I mentioned above, and is appropriately slower than the RTX 3080. If AMD wants to make up ground against Nvidia, their prices need to be way lower, especially if they're going with the whole schtick of no raytracing but better rasterization. Honestly right now I'm not really seeing the better rasterization part so right now it's just no raytracing and similar rasterization. This, combined with AMD's poor past reputation when it comes to software support like drivers, makes for a bad sell this generation. Raytracing is the future, whether some of us want it or not, and Nvidia's currently delivering it. Personally, until AMD can prove that they have an altogether better product with proper software support, I'll probably be sticking with Nvidia. \n\nNo shade on AMD, they're a smaller company with a fraction the resources Nvidia has (especially when it comes to software development) and they've done great in continuing to bridge the gap between them, but for me it's just not there yet especially when adding raytracing and DLSS into the equation.", "&gt; This, combined with AMD's poor past reputation when it comes to software support like drivers, makes for a bad sell this generation. \n\ndespite the fact that Nvidia still lacks CPU overhead in their drivers [for multiple generations now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoZB-cnjc0) and its gotten even worse with the current generation?

Although AMD's CPU market share is growing, intel's still has the lead primarily because people take long periods of time upgrading their CPU compared to their GPUs, which becomes a huge problem because usually new reviews use top end cpus to alleviate bottlenecks when in reality that's not the typical kind of setup one would see.", "I'd never do it on my laptop and my laptop is hot garbage (Dell G5 SE) but I know this is a huge thing for everyone due to the crazy temperatures these laptops can hit.

A lot of people don't know how to change thermal paste or are too scared so they disable boost.\n\nA lot of laptop manufacturers are installing inadequate heatsinks in these laptops and getting away with it just because AMD said the max operating temp is 105C.

The former makes for an interesting period - those CPUs are made to be priced competitively, but with shortage of material/staff due to our global pandemic it should test their ability to funnel resources to right holes at the right time and making sure to keep their now expectant customer base happy.

Yes, Intel has had a bad two years, and yes there has been leadership changes. However, when we talk about moat, the fact *despite* a rough two years intel has not lost much of its value. It has superior financial strength, more cash than they know what to do with, and profit margins AMD and NVidia can only dream of right now. AMD and NVidia are in growth mode right now, its easy to see their stocks skyrocketing, but they don't have market cap anywhere close to Intel. You could see when people rotated out of stocks AMD and NVidia saw a stark decline, while Intel relatively stayed the same. This is the \"margin of safety\" concept people talk about. Intel has the lowest PE ratio out of the big chipmakers, and actually has consistently paid good dividends for over a decade.

If someone is willing to spend enough on that, they will likely be willing to spend on a higher end APU.\n\nThat said, I do think that AMD could include more CUs in its entry level desktop APU.

Por como est\u00e1 el precio hoy en d\u00eda, si necesit\u00e1s urgente una gpu, pod\u00e9s laburar con una 1650 de 4gb tranquilo hasta poder upgradear. Si es DDR6 mejor. Para workstation SIEMPRE gpus de nvidia. Los codecs de renderizado y otros que tienen mean a los de AMD.\n\n- Por el otro lado, si tu presupuesto est\u00e1 acotado, el Ryzen 9 3900x me parece un poco overkill para motion graphics. Con un 5 5600x o 7 3700x vas a volar. \n\n- Si vas a comprar un M2 te recomiendo que m\u00ednimo tenga 3000 Mb/s de lectura. Pod\u00e9s usar uno de 256 gb que no te va a cambiar mucho. El que yo estoy usando actualmente es el Xpg Gamix S11 Pro de 256gb. Es una bestia y es dentro de todo barato. \n\n- Fuente: componente PRINCIPAL de la Pc. En el que menos queres ratonear. De este va a depender la \"salud\" de tus componentes, y puede disminuir mucho la calidad de vida si usas una mala fuente.

Pod\u00e9s safar con 500 pero no es lo recomendable. Y trat\u00e1 de que las certificaciones siempre sean 80+ bronze para arriba. NUNCA comprar gpu sin certificaci\u00f3n 80+.

As for your unexpected shutdowns, from my experience AMD processors handle thermal limits a little less gracefully than Intel's. Set-it-and-forget-it overclocking profiles occasionally just don't work whether due to thermal solutions or the silicon lottery. You did the right thing tweaking it down. Additionally if you are using quad channel RAM that might contribute to instability, especially if an overclock is just about stable in dual channel. I would double and triple check your thermal paste application to make sure you got full coverage and didn't do something like leave the protective plastic on the AIO. It happens. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2: A SATA drive may or may not be cheaper, so a more cost effective solution for your storage drive (depending on sales, and whether or not there are any PC components to actually buy).

I made sure the plastic was off! I think the preapplied paste COULD have possibly been smudged a bit, as my MOBO is a pain in the arse to mount an AIO on with AMD brackets (it has those lame clip mounts that bend). As for the quad channel RAM, this was happening before I went from 2 to 4 channels, so that does not seem to be the issue. I did however find that one XMP profile was disabled for gaming boost or whatever MSI calls it, and messing with it made the issue happen less often. \n\n2. Sounds good! They're pretty abundant at the Best Buy around here and similarly priced, so not a problem. One question in return, how do I set the primary SSD to run everything like games and applications? I will literally only be using the second one for files. (IE is this something thats configured in BIOS and how would I go about doing so)\n\n3. After doing some stress tests on the CPU and GPU, CPU idles at 40-low 50s, GPU at low 50s. At 100% load on a stress test, CPU max was 71 C, GPU was 73. So I think that's good!

I'm on Windows and I have already disabled about everything on startup! Ofc other than ICue, Wallpaper engine, stuff like that. \n\nThanks again!", "This guide is unfortunately filled with lots of misinformation.\n\n&gt;False. Sure, having more RAM will speed up in very special cases (like if you upgrade 1GB to 4GB). Normally what matters is not how much RAM you have. But rather how fast you can access the RAM. A 4GB DDR4 RAM is better than a 16GB RAM from 2001.\n\nBesides the fact that you really can't mix RAM types on most platforms (apart from 100 series Intel), I would much, much rather have 16GB RAM DDR, even if it's slower. If you have 4GB DDR4, but it hits the pagefile frequently, you will have worse performance than if you had 8GB DDR3 or DDR2.\n\n\n&gt;NO. DirectX is just Windows cute version of OpenGL. Running D3DX games can be fast. But you should always rely on OpenGL if you want the fastest speed (since D3DX sometimes resorts to software rendering *sometimes*).\n\nAbsolute nonsense. DirectX is COMPLETELY unrelated to OpenGL. OpenGL has been deprecated for a while now, and very frequently performs around the same or worse than DirectX or Vulkan. Even on nVidia GPUs, OpenGL performance is only higher than what AMD GPUs offer for openGL, and it'll still be beaten by newer APIs. In Linux, Wine and Proton have advanced enough that most people are fine running with DirectX.\n\n\n&gt;You should check that your graphics card is dedicated, if it is integrated your GTA 6 will run at 1 frame per year. Integrated graphic cards often rely on the motherboard RAM for operating. And thus consequently slower as they depend on an external device. Discrete graphic cards often come with their own RAM they can use faster.\n\n\n&gt;Integrated === Square in motherboard\n\n\n&gt;Discrete === You can unplug it from the PCI thingy.\n\n\nThis information is immensely outdated. For one, integrated graphics have come a long way from whatever your era of hardware is. (Q35 iGPU) Starting from Clarkdale, iGPUs are integrated into the CPU rather than being on the motherboard. As such, your method of differentiating isn't valid. Especially if the user has a laptop... by your definition, a mobile GTX 1060 would count as integrated because 99% of the time it cannot be unplugged.\n\n\n&gt;Old games are often left unoptimized and they are single core. Meaning they only use a CPU at a time. Your i9 has like 16 cores, but the game only uses 1; so consequently it's slower.\n\n\n&gt;Your graphics card should take care for most of the rendering, so this should be rare.\n\n\n&gt;If you ever encounter this, your best option is to reverse engineer the game or find a patch which makes it multithreaded.\n\nI am highly, highly, HIGHLY doubtful that a modern i9 or Ryzen 9 wouldn't be able to handle workloads that are single threaded from 2005. I imagine those workloads were made with 2005 CPUs in mind, and if those were able to handle it, a modern CPU would be nothing short of a miracle in comparison, even if it were a Ryzen 3 or i3. Both single core and multi core performance have made strides since that era. Hell, a Core 2 Duo was already a massive improvement. As for reverse engineering, uh... what?\n\n&gt;What is better, faster CPU or more RAM?\n\n\n&gt;Fast CPU.\n\nArguable. In some cases, you would benefit from more RAM, especially if you already have more than enough for the platform. Not to mention a Ryzen 9 5950x wouldn't fare very well with 4GB DDR4. In general, you want to make sure that you're not getting too much memory for the platform, and that some investments are not great as a faster CPU or more RAM wouldn't help much with performance, like an LGA775 machine with 8GB RAM vs 4GB.\n\n\nI appreciate the effort you put into your guide, but a lot of it really only applies to very old hardware, or specific use cases (Linux with Wine) and a lot of it is just flat out wrong.", "There are Add-in cards for Thunderbolt. However outside of Apple, Thunderbolt ecosystem is not that developed. Mostly because:  \n1) Ridiculous price premium on Motherboard prices.  \n2) Non enthusiastic companies unwilling to promote it.   \n3) Ridiculous price premium on peripherals.  \n4) Lack of PCIe lanes on Non-HEDT platforms.

But there are some AMD motherboards with indirect Thunderbolt 3 support- basically, a TB3 header where you'll need to buy a TB3 card and have a cable connected. They did not have direct support- ie an I/O port. I guess this was the only way to have some form of TB3 support without Intel certification. Receptacles- Type C and the header- does not belong to Intel. But out of nowhere, there is one AMD motherboard that did have direct TB3 support, therefore it did get Intel certification:  X570 Phantom Gaming-ITX/TB3. In fact, many AMD motherboards with WiFi support use Intel WiFi+BT M.2 cards. But it is a different story with notebooks. And it's a lot of hope to see this happen based on 1 motherboard.   \n\n\nI am sure notebook manufacturers could talk to Intel.

After 2 months in AMD service they gave me money back", "AMD just makes the better CPUs at the moment, especially at the high end they're making Intel eat dirt. But that could also be advantageously to you, the current gen i7 and i9 might be embarrassments, but losing the high end actually forced Intel to compete in the lower segments harder. As a result, especially the 11th gen i5 lineup is quite good and priced very competitively. The i5 11600K is basically all you need for games at the moment, and cheaper than the 5600X. It's still less efficient, but the performance is similar. Both AMD and Intel will introduce a new Mainboard platform soon, so you're not missing out on a lot of potential upgrades on either side (or you could wait for the next gens if you are in no rush.)\nGenerally, it's pretty childish to buy a CPU because you like or dislike a brand. You're not supposed to be friends with your CPU, it's supposed to perform. AMD currently just has the better technology, and it's Intel that has been intentionally limiting hardware to sell more expensive one for years. For example, Intel has been preventing customers from using fast RAM on cheap boards just so they can sell more high-end boards, even though Ryzen, which doesn't have that limitation, shows that even in dirt cheap boards you can run pretty fast RAM. Not to forget that Intel also makes you pay up for overclockable CPUs, while all Ryzen CPUs are overclockable by default. It's stuff like that that would make me understand that people *don't* like Intel. But holding on to a brand just because it *used to be* better just makes no sense. I'm sure Intel will have a comeback soon-ish, at least I hope so, but right now, most of their products are jokes with technology from 2016 recycled for the 5th time.\n\nSo that's that, try not to be emotional or naive to marketing when picking hardware, check in benchmarks what is the best bang for the buck in your budget. Might be the i5-11600K, could also be a Ryzen. Get what's objectively the best and neither blindly follow the Ryzen hype nor the nostalgic Intel fanboys.\n\nBack to the main question.\nGenerally, neither CPU nor GPU preform worse depending on what brand they're paired with. They perform up to their performance. But there are cases where an AMD CPU+GPU combo can have better performance, mainly because of Smart Access Memory. It allows the GPU to share its fast memory with the CPU, based on the PCIe Rezisable BAR technology. Depending on the game, that can improve performance by up to 10%, but there are also games where it makes no difference at all. So I wouldn't put that feature too high on my list. Additionally, in my experience, AMD's GPU drivers still kinda suck. Since I have Nvidia, my system is just running more stable than it ever did with AMD Radeon. Wouldn't trade that for 10% more performance. Who cares whether or not you have 5-10 more FPS when you get black screens or flickering from time to time. That's what my experience was with the Vega 64. Perhaps it has become better, but at least with the Radeon 5000 Series, I've still been seeing many complaints about the drivers.\n\nYou can keep SAM in the back of the head, as well as (personal opinion!) Nvidia's better stability, and decide what's more important to you. Or when you get an Intel CPU, just pick the GPU that has better performance for its price.", "???

Basically overclocking means increasing clockspeed, and that has no effects on the longevity of your processor or graphics card.

Intel i9 9900K) for example are able to be overclocked, but most Intel desktop processors and practically all of their laptop CPUs doesn't have this and as such are not able to be overclocked.\n\nAll AMD desktop CPUs on the other hand are able to be overclocked compared to Intel, but just like Intel only specific (although much more) laptop processors are able to be overclocked.\n\n\n\nIf you're going to overclock your processor/graphics card (I don't know whether or not your processor is able to be overclocked since you didn't specify the model name) as you are inexperienced I would avoid increasing the voltage on your components. You also want to keep your temperature below 90C, and optimally below 80C (but not required) however the lower the temperature the better. \n\nIf you want to reduce the temperature and noise of your laptop and increase battery life, I would recommend undervolting your laptop components, this also prolongs the longevity of your laptop as reducing voltage means you're putting less stress on your components while also increasing performance. \n\nOtherwise you can also just increase the clockspeed of them. If you give them too much clockspeed or too little voltage your laptop may crash or start getting weird artifacts, but this is completely normal and when this happens you just restart the laptop and reduce the clockspeed/voltage back to a number that is stable and you are good to go.\n\nLong post I know, but I hope this helps and should explain the basics for you!", "&gt;made sure I am not overclocking\n\nAlso made sure your card is not factory overclocked?

Imagination refused to supply any driver except a 32-bit Windows driver, and Imagination dropped driver support of it as soon as possible. The CPUs are 64-bit capable and can run a 64-bit OS, but they have to run a 32-bit OS in order to have a graphics driver.

AMD obliged. AMD knows that their OEM customers want the source code to the drivers. Releasing the source code to everyone is synergistic with releasing the source code to their OEM customers.\n\n---\n\n\nThere's a case to be made that it doesn't fundamentally matter whether applications are open-source or not, but that drivers should always be open-source.

The third generation brought in almost equal gaming performance to Intel\u2019s offering and helped push for PCIe Gen 4.0 to become the standard. The fourth generation (which is weirdly named the Ryzen 5000 series) smashed Intel in both workstation and gaming performance that even Intel 11th Gen offerings haven\u2019t beaten. \n\nFor solely gaming I wouldn\u2019t focus on a brand name with the volatility of the current PC market, and instead look for the cheapest price option for performance :D", "Try running the DX web updater and do a clean graphics driver install by removing it with DDU and then installing the latest stable version from AMD website.

This way companies made both products. \n\nWith RTX 30 - Nvidia made it too cheap: \n* A $500 card outperforms a $1,200 card. \n* A $175 3050 might compete with a $300 2060. \n\nBecause of this, companies discontinued the old products. \n\nNo one wants to make a $1,300 card and have to sell it for $450. \n\nNo one wants to make a $300 card and have to sell it for $150. \n\nRight now if they sell it they could sell it for even more - but once RTX 30 is in stock, they're totally screwed. \n\nIf Nvidia targeted the $700-$2000 range with the new products, and let the old products fill the $100-$600 range - we'd have way less shortage. \n\n____\n\nAMD unquestionably has the best CPUs - the Ryzen 5000 series is top notch. I personally use a 5900X, and I'm content with it. \n\nIf you have a big bakery that makes 50,000 loaves a day - they might make more profit by selling more product. \n\nIf you have a small bakery and they only have enough ovens to make 50 loaves a day - they make more money by charging more. \n\nIf each loaf costs $2 to make. \n\nAt $2.50 retail - that's 50\u00a2 profit. With 50 loaves that's $25 a day. \n\nAt $5 retail - that's $2.50 profit. If they sell 10 loaves, that's $25 a day. \n\nSo for the small bakery - selling 11 loaves at a high price is better than selling 50 loaves at a low price. \n\nAt the end of the day - most people buy the industrial bread. \n\nIntel is the big baker - they have a loaf/chip for the commoners. \n\nAMD is the artisan baker. Their bread is better - they make money by charging more. \n\nAMD doesn't want to waste money making cheap bread. When you can only make 50 loaves a day - they want to make expensive loaves. \n\nIn the US - good luck getting a 1600AF, 2200G, 2400G, 3000G, 3200G, 3400G, 3100, 3300x, or 3500.

The differences can be attributed to a few factors:\n\n * Some of the tasks are better suited for one CPU architecture over another (despite both AMD and intel using the same Intel x86 instruction set). \n * Under the hood, numpy uses this thing called LAPACK, which is a linear algebra package (which is used in pretty much all these tasks here). There are multiple implementations of LAPACK. Intel MKL and OpenBLAS are two of them (and are perhaps the most common). The differences between these implementations are basically that they do some tasks quickly and some tasks slower. So the speed depends on which one you're using.\n\nRegarding the second point, intel MKL, as stated in the name, is developed by intel. Intel being intel, decided that they were going to use the slow version of the code if it detects that you're on a non-intel machine. If it detects an intel machine, it will use the most optimized version, hence making it run faster on intel devices. \n\nAMD users either had to use the slow version of MKL, or use OpenBLAS instead. The problem is that OpenBLAS can be pretty slow on a lot of tasks too. \n\nRecently, intel claims to have \"fixed\" this for AMD users (which is only partially true).\n\nThere is some discussion about these online, but because most of the general public aren't coders (or don't suspect there to be a difference), it isn't talked about as much.

The ones where the name ends in 'X' do not have integrated graphics, so you need to buy a separate graphics card if you use them. Ones not ending in X (G, H, HS) have integrated GPUs. You'd probably want to get 'G' here since you're building a desktop machine.\n\nFor Intel it works much the same. Processors ending in 'X' do not have integrated graphics while ones not ending in 'X' (K, F, no letter) typically do.\n\nRelevant to your question is also what video codecs have hardware support. This is usually added on a generational basis, so you should check out what video codecs are supported natively for e.g. Ryzen 4 series, 5 series, 10th and 11th generation Intel etc.", "This is what I tried to stress about 2 weeks ago that went mostly two deaf ears that Shoe Bots had this tech all wrapped into specialized closed source code 3rd party apps (StellarAIO, Estock, etc) and have been using it to quickly buy up any stock that came available from all the online retailers that sale GPUs, because the online sites of today are not capable of fighting the hacking tools of today.  This has been going on in the GPU scene since NVIDIA launched in September off their website, then ultimately shutdown their store because they saw the issue and knew it was nothing they could do to address it and instead chose to offhand their FE cards via Best Buy.   The Shoe Bots then just spread to other online retailers including BB.  NewEgg, Amazon, B&amp;H, all the Digital River ran stores including AMD's, and have set up a full scalping underground market, of buying up the cards first through their API hacking bots then flipping them back to consumers.  This has been going on for nearly 7 months now.\n\nFor a great time the tech industry set silent, then starting flat out blaming the \"cryptocurrency miner boogyman\"  meanwhile Shoe Bot scalpers continued on draining e-retails of their GPU stock, so they could flip the cards through resale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe real fix for this would be to cut the cord of online retail, the channels being used right now is broken.   None of these companies put a good enough filter in place that would stop these high tech bots.

Had these outlets simply copied Micro-Center's style, of sold in brick and mortars only, with limit 1 per customer,  most of the real people who wanted a new GPU since last fall would have likely got one by now.    Best Buy really upsets me because they have about 800 brick &amp; mortar stores and instead of mimicking Micro-Center they chose to do online only for GPUs and so most of their cards went right to Shoe-Bots to be flipped for resale profit.", "I was experimenting with this on my laptop just to see what Quicksync was capable of.

The streams were all transcoding at hundreds of frames per second.\n\nI can't say what the abilities of the AMD APUs are, but my Radeon RX550 card is basically a no go for transcoding as I run Jellyfin on my Debian server and Polaris cards have a serious performance issue in software when using VAAPI.

It's also why voltages on Ryzen are so confusing (ryzen can idle at 1.5 volts, but overclocking with 1.3 volts is often dangerous).  See also this [commentary about degradation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMHUz16MuYA).\n\nWhat's left for AMD in terms of actual fun with overclocking is RAM tweaking, but that's also possible on intel too.\n\nOverclocking on Intel is still fun as intel has a unsophisticated/primitive boosting algorithm that [only really considers time and power](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/datasheets/8th-gen-core-family-datasheet-vol-1.pdf#G6.1716273) (and sorta voltage and temperature, but in a primitive way; not like how AMD does).

I'm more used to calling the such 'amalgamations', like [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html).\n\nSQLite is a database. It could be used as part of compilation, but a Unity file is just a giant file that optimizes translation units. It reduces parsing and compiling of header files, and reduces the overhead of generating large amounts of object files. Unity files don't scale poorly with multithreading. But, it still catches naming issues, and might provide optimizations.\n\nReally, to figure out what cpu you need for the best performance you need months of tuning and a ton of different computers to test how to optimize the build speed on different hardware setups.\n\n\\&gt;Also, you might be interested in [ccache](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ccache), which caches compiled code objects and references them instead of recompilation. Useful when only a few files are being edited.\n\nccahe is awesome. Again it depends on tuning. Usually it takes longer the first compile; but, all future compiles should be faster. Also depends on whether the project is coded to be able to take advantage of it fully. \n\nAll of this stuff is complicated, and AMD chips probably perform the best out of the box right now. Intel might win if you spend a lot of time playing around with settings. But, that might require tuning of how the system is setup, and usually just using the ck kernel gives the best speed performance with the least headaches.\n\nThe only problem with AMD is typically Intel has better compatibility with hardware for historical reasons. That's improving and might not be an issue right now. Probably, mostly impacts gpus.", "Update the latest BIOS of that MoBo.\n\nThe PCIe 4.0 in AMD systems is not fully compatible backwards with sound cards that are PCIe 1.0.", "Roll back your drivers, AMD broke something.

Or buy the (relatively cheap) consumer counterparts and extrapolate.\n\nFor the laymen, I refer to to the community for benchmarks and use them as a heuristic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;All of this stuff is complicated, and AMD chips probably perform the  best out of the box right now.

However it depends on how you want to normalise/constrain, as intel is looking to be better on the [low-end/tight budget builds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyGFKCrnPM4) right now.

Thank you for your help.", "Hey OP \u2014 Tech Support posts are only allowed in the [Q1'21 Tech Support Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/koajra/q121_tech_support_megathread/)\n\nYou may also wish to visit /r/AMDHelp and /r/TechSupport", "Not an expert by any means (almost completely an amateur but have been looking into this topic with a similar budget/goal), but my two cents\u2014it depends on the program she's using. Mostly commenting on the CPU/iGPU situation, can't comment on any parts other than that (though the PSU seems to be in the low priority section of the LTT PSU tier list, which could be a lack of info or observed problems, likely the former).\n\nWhile you may be able to look up benchmarks for the specific CPUs &amp; iGPUs for different programs, Photoshop for instance is primarily bottlenecked by the CPU in terms of general operations (with a few specific tools/exceptions iirc) and should be fine with both the CPUs listed. Some programs use more GPU than others though (have heard some integrate it heavily for some brush things), and if she wants to get into 3d modeling in the future then a GPU may matter a lot (except for heavy usage, you'd likely want a dedicated GPU anyway).\n\nThis said, the 3400g seems to be out of stock on PcPartPicker (in America, where I assume you are located) with significant scalping that bumps it up something like $100 from some retail options like Best Buy. That's a pretty significant uptick in cost. Also, having a better CPU could mean a better upgrade path when GPUs become accessible again in... 2022 or 2023. Personally, I might say 3400g if you can get one at msrp (can also downgrade the motherboard in that case if budget is a concern) but otherwise the 11600k seems decent in that it's not scalped and has arguably better long-term usability.\n\nA side note for budget, I suspect a cheaper motherboard would be serviceable, and some people might recommend a higher wattage on the PSU but according to calculators it'd probably be fine unless she's aiming to have something stronger than a 2060 in the future. Arguably worth it in the long run since a good PSU can last a long time, but also not a priority if she isn't thinking of that for a while.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIn my non-expert opinion, both are probably fine. Check the programs she uses and plans to use (maybe pop by their subreddits and ask about any bottlenecks) as there could be some variation there. Look into what she can actually get as well, since the 3400g is MIA atm, plus any sales (I'm not confident enough to recommend alternatives, but maybe someone else might be able to).\n\nEdit: if you trust Ali Express or Ebay, you can find the 4XXX AMD APUs, which have better processors (Zen2 vs Zen+) and more cores than the 3400g (depending on which APU) while having a worse iGPU for some reason (Vega 8?). This still beats out Intel's iGPU though. Late this year consumers will also get access to 5XXX APUs from AMD which will be on Zen3 I believe.\n\nHope that helped somewhat, saw 0 comments so figured it might be better than nothing.", "Thanks for the input, I did take a look at the 4350 which looks like it may outclass the 3400G. If I go AMD, I may go with that one. I am certainly not a fan of Intel, but the improved cpu of the 11600 is definitely compelling for longterm usage. I'll take another look at the PSU, I was hoping to snag a 3060ti, so I may need to upgrade.\n\nThe end goal of this is to have a pc that she can use to generate an income, so I want her to have professional capabilities with it.", "Pretty bullish on INTC, oil (RDS-B), and Japanese railways. \n\nI'm confident INTC will turn things around in the next 3 to 5 years. I think they've got quite a moat left and can't imagine they will go down without a fight. It wasn't long ago my colleagues at work were scoffing at my rig for having an AMD chip instead of Intel. Now it's the opposite, and ironically, I have an Intel chip in my current rig. Things change quickly in this industry.\n\nI love the idea of clean energy vehicles, but I try to be a realist. Despite the hype around clean energy tech and EVs, there lies a brutal gauntlet ahead for that market, between costs related to materials and R&amp;D, lack of widespread public infrastructure outside domestic cities, promotional hurdles and resisting sentiment (e.g., petrolheads will hardly let up driving gas-guzzling tankers like Caddies and Cudas), and the most important thing of all: The price tag. EVs are the future, but the market has priced in the future over ten years away. As much as I hate to say it, oil will probably be sticking around for at least another decade.\n\nThe Japanese rails thing is pretty much just a reopening play. People like to cite the work-from-home threat but these rails are used for a lot more than just commuting. People shop, have social lives, and travel.\n\nEverything else in my portfolio right now is basically a hold for me so while I *was* bullish on those, I'm more neutral now.", "Isn\u2019t the 1650ti better? Genuinely asking cause I have no idea about AMD mobile GPUs!\nEdit: NVM I just checked it out &amp; apparently the 5600M is at par with the 1660ti which is nearly at par with 2060MAXQ, making the 5600M at par with the 2060MAXQ", "I'm in the same boat, alot of my value plays have become slightly less desirable to keep buying, which is why I am trying to broaden out a bit into tech, as I actually saw some decent plays there. I do like the ev play, but stock wise it's extremely ridiculous and I don't see much money to be made. \n\nChevron and toyota have a solid new-ish deal with Chevron providing cleaner hydrogen for toyotas fuel cells and also investing in the infrastructure required for said fuel cells. I am a long term bull on green hydrogen, that being said, the only realistic stock for me to play this with is APD, everything else is un-investable right now. I did like Ballard power at sub $10. \n\nI chose to go safe with the ev market and I bought lithium mining stocks last year, particularly Livent and albemarle, but I have exited those positions since the prices they were at didn't make much sense, I had to take all my profits. I also invested in platinum/palladium mining companies (mainly sibanye-stillwater) because EVs and hybrids use a lot more of those platinum group metals than ICE cars. I figured that was the safest exposure to that bubble. \n\nA Japanese rail play is actually very out of the box and I respect that play. That's some shit that I would come up with haha. \n\nIntel is gonna take time, but I think Pat is good for it long term. And you're right, I used to hate on AMD and now all my buds hate me because I'm running an i9 instead of a AMD processor. I do hold AMD as well, but I think both companies will thrive and coexist well, especially if Intel's plans to get into the foundry business eleviate some of the data center market share risk. If anybody can pull it off, it'll be intel. They have massive pockets and a lot of government backing to make sure they succeed.", "I've made money on AMD, but I'm not buying shit until this situation is resolved!

The potential market shift is exciting to think about long term. Their electronic bikes are also really starting to take off in my city at least. They\u2019re everywhere. I believe more people will be taking short trips on bikes in cities as we crowd out all of the parking.", "Any chance AMD will just keep issuing more shares to achieve greater market cap?", "&gt; So maybe they added a feature for amd cards on gsync, but idk.\n\nThey did 2 years ago, all the new G-Sync V2 modules work with AMD GPUs.

A basic aftermarket cooler like the Cooler Master Hyper 212 or ID-Cooling SE-224-XT will make the PC much quieter and keep the CPU cooler. No need for anything more expensive for this 65W CPU. Note that liquid AIOs are more expensive for the same level of cooling performance and have a shorter expected lifespan (due to the extra points of failure in the pump and tubes). Your money is better spent on the video card.\n* **Motherboard:** Cheapest compatible motherboard with at least four memory slots and four fan headers. It's a microATX board which means it's a bit shorter than standard ATX boards. Some people dislike the appearance of microATX boards in mid-tower cases, but the video card will be blocking your view of the bottom of the case anyway unless you have the case at eye level. You can spend an extra 20 euro for the [standard ATX version](https://es.pcpartpicker.com/product/PCKcCJ/asrock-b450-pro4-atx-am4-motherboard-b450-pro4) if you want.\n* **Memory:** 3600mhz CL16 is the price/performance sweet spot right now. 16GB standard.\n* **SSD:**  Cheapest 500GB TLC NVMe SSD with a DRAM cache. Because you'll be video editing, it is worth paying a small premium here to get something a bit faster and more durable than the cheapest NVMe SSDs.\n* **Video Card:** Strongest GPU that fits the budget. \n* **Case:** Tempered glass window. Mesh front panel for high airflow. Comes with 3 ARGB fans and I've added an additional fan for the rear exhaust.\n* **Power Supply:** [Tier A](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1116640-psucultists-psu-tier-list/) PSU recommended for high-end gaming PCs. 550W is more than enough for this ~335W system. \n* **Monitor:** Cheapest 144hz 1080p IPS panel monitor with good response times and a decent quality stand with height adjustment.\n* **Keyboard:** Cheapest keyboard with \"Red\" type mechanical switches, a tenkeyless layout, and with backlit keys. You want Red switches because they are generally considered the best type for gaming due to their linear action and quiet sound profile. Tenkeyless keyboards (no numpad) are preferred among gamers because the board is shorter and you therefore have more room for the mouse.\n* **Desk:** Basic desk. I have a very similar one.

How hard would it be to apply a node shrink to 5nm and repurpose these as mobile/desktop processors?\n\nWindows can run on Arm as can Linux, what Apple did was to make migration from x86 to Arm easy for devs and more importantly nearly seamless for the user experience. \n\nThe fight is not Apple vs Windows but Arm vs x86_64 or more abstractly RISC vs CISC Apple were just the first to do an Arm based computer with desktop class performance well and in a way that doesn\u2019t feel restrictive like the Surface RT on WinRT. In part they were pushed toward this by years of Intel CPUs being stuck at 14nm, CPU quality control and supply constraint allowing the iPad Pro SoC to be ported to the Mac without any performance penalty while retaining the inherent power efficiency benefits of RISC.\n\nApple Silicon is not ready to replace the discrete GPUs in their 27\u201d and 16\u201d models.

I did this as the card would hit over 1000 FPS in some game menus and the coil whine was pretty loud when that happened", "NVIDIA has the best raw performance under proprietary drivers, however, there are some compositors (such as KWin on Plasma) that do not work properly with it and require you to do some fiddling. You may need to turn on Force Composition Pipeline in NVIDIA X Settings if you want to get rid of the tearing at cost of small stutters. Sometimes, the driver won't behave properly and glitch out some graphical stuff, such as the text glitching out on some games from time to time or Vulkan render being so screwed up in others. My point is, it can be a hassle and, since you are dependent on NVIDIA to fix them, it may take some time to, 1st get the driver into the beta and then some more time for it to be released as stable. Additional features, such as hardware acceleration for XWayland is missing, along with the 128 MB shader cache limit still being on, which depending on the game, it may cause it to stutter due to shaders being compiled unless you disable it with an environment variable. Also if you are on Optimus supported laptop, any driver version older than 390.xx forces you to use a much older method of getting the PRIME support going which can be a PITA to set.\n\nTo me, the biggest difference is just how little I even need to think about drivers with my AMD card. Plug, play, and never worry about it anymore. It just feels like a completely natural part of my Linux system. Other than there being some stability issues with new AMD hardware, which makes sense, plugging in an AMD graphics card feels no different than plugging in a generic USB keyboard or mouse. It just works and behaves like any other natively supported piece of hardware.\n\nWith my Nvidia graphics card, there always seem to be some weird quirks. I need to use strange workarounds and startup scripts to get basic stuff like a tear-free experience to work. I can't just set tear-free in my xorg.conf like I can with both Intel and AMD. I need to mess around with kernel parameters to get tty to work properly. I also see various weird graphical artifacts in my window manager every now and then with Nvidia cards. In general, configuring Nvidia cards and getting the configuration to stick between reboots is janky, finicky, and brittle.\n\nNone of this happens with Nouveau, but you know it ain't fit if you're looking to squeeze the performance out from your awesome NVIDIA card.

If you're not looking to upgrade this machine in place in another couple of years then I'd just go with Intel, either a 10700 or 10900, K if you wanna overclock a little for more performance, non-K otherwise to save a few $$$.\n\nIf you do want to upgrade in place then go for an AMD setup and grab a 5600X or maybe a 5800X if you need more cores.\n\nIn either case you're probably going to want about 32gb of memory, probably in 2x16 format. 3200MHz if you're going more budget, 3600MHz if not, and definitely 3600 CL16 if you're going to overclock it for daily use.\n\nOn the Motherboard for the AMD side I'd recommend the Asus Tuf x570 Pro (Wi-Fi). It's a little more expensive than some options but it's very solid and pretty fantastic bang for buck, especially if you're going to do a bit of OCing to get more bang out of your budget. I don't know too much about intel boards right now but you'll probably want something in a Z490. The X590s are the new shiny stuff, but from what little I've seen I'm not sure they're really worth it right now. Listen to others or do your own research here though.\n\nFinally, on the CPU cooler, you can either go budget and grab a Hyper 212 Evo for about $30 which will cool \"alright\", or you can grab an NH-D15 or NH-D15S for about $90 and $100 respectively. It looks like your case will *barely* fit an NH-D15 (note, you may want the S variant for both budget and RAM clearance reasons) and it'll keep things as cool as it can (your case isn't amazing for cooling, but it shouldn't cook anything).\n\nThe reason I mention OCing a few times in here, is with both AMD and Intel you should have a fairly easy time doing some light overclocking and squeezing a decent amount more performance out of your system. At least 10% overall probably. It's a lot easier and a lot safer now than it was even 6 years ago, and there's a ton of guides to overclocking with an eye towards daily use. The only risk is that if your case has worse temps than I'm thinking it may end up being your bottleneck and end up needing replacement as well.\n\nOverall I'd estimate your budget is doable right now, barely, with about $350-450 on the CPU, ~$200 on the memory, ~$150 on a Motherboard (maybe closer to 200), and either $30 or ~$100 on a CPU cooler. That puts you at either ~$700 for the lower end setup with a 10700K or 5600X, or closer to $900 with a 10900k, higher end motherboard, and possibly the higher end CPU cooler.", "AMD RX580", "This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

The first thing I need to ask is if you are sure that you monitor is 21\u201d and not 24\u201d. Because apparently all [the 21\u201d AOC monitors are ancient ](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/products/monitor/#F=381000000,541020000&amp;m=143) and use TN panels. Quick way to check is to go into display settings on windows and check your monitors resolution and refresh rate. If the resolution is below 1080x1920 or the refresh rate is 60hz or lower, you need an upgrade. \n\nSo anyways, about the build:\n\n###Processor:\nIf a Ryzen 5 5600 (without the X) or 5600G (with integrated graphics) comes out by then, take that instead. The 5600x might be overkill. Obviously the situation will likely change in the future so make sure to check back in in a year or so. It might also be worth going intel with the core i5-11400 currently being the best value processor. \n###CPU cooler:\nYou definitely don\u2019t need liquid cooling, unless you are just after looks. A boxed cooler will comes if you pick up the 5600x, and will also very likely come with any other upcoming Ryzen processors. You can use that to keep the CPU cool, and if you really want something quite and find that the stock cooler isn\u2019t enough, you can get a cheap  [air cooler](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/PnPKHx/arctic-freezer-34-esports-duo-cpu-cooler-acfre00061a). \n###Motherboard:\nGood choice. Won\u2019t be changing that. Good amount of expansion slots, good rear I/O, brilliant thermals, WiFi support. \n###Memory:\nThe kit I took has slightly lower latency for a bit more FPS and is also a bit cheaper.\n###Storage:\nFast SSDs and slow SSDs don\u2019t really differentiate by a lot. Even though say [a PCIE 4.0 SSD with 5GB/s read and write speeds](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/fVYQzy/sabrent-rocket-40-1-tb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-sb-rocket-nvme4-1tb) should perform ten times as well as a [SATA III SSD with 500MB/S read and writes](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/yzfhP6/samsung-860-evo-1tb-25-solid-state-drive-mz-76e1t0bam), the difference is actually really [small](https://youtu.be/4YoRKQy-UO4). \n###Graphics card:\nIn my opinion, the rx 6700 xt is a pretty shit graphics card. The rtx 3060 ti is around 2% slower yet quite a bit cheaper and has DLSS. The rtx 3070 is around 7% better for just an extra \u00a320. In my opinion, I feel like AMD was thinking \u201ceverything will sell in this market, why not make shit products and have them sell anyways?\u201d Just like nVidia did with the rtx 3060. That being said, rx 6700 xt\u2019s will likely be in stock faster due to less demand and lower mining capabilities. \n###Case:\nGood choice, will leave it. \n###Power supply:\nThat one will [probably be dead on arrival or explode (look at reviews). ](https://www.newegg.com/global/sg-en/gigabyte-gp-p750gm-750w/p/N82E16817233029?Item=N82E16817233029&amp;nm_mc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-RAN-COM&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_source=afc-PCPartPicker&amp;AFFID=2558510&amp;AFFNAME=PCPartPicker&amp;ACRID=1&amp;ASID=https%3a%2f%2fpcpartpicker.com%2fproduct%2fRhH8TW%2fgigabyte-750-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-gp-p750gm&amp;ranMID=44583&amp;ranEAID=2558510&amp;ranSiteID=8BacdVP0GFs-nf8t..CMSLjPCmLIFRLVhA) It\u2019s also ranked in the [avoid tier](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1116640-psucultists-psu-tier-list/) and [failed tech power ups torture testing quickly. ](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/gigabyte-gp-p750gm-750-w/3.html). The EVGA G3 has less than a 2% failure rate (Amazon reviews) and has a 7 year warranty and full Japanese capacitors unlike the shitty ones that the P750GM uses. \n###Monitor:\nIf you want, you can upgrade to a 1440p monitor. This is a decent step up from 1080p, and is especially recommended if your monitor is 60hz or not full HD. Your build has enough horsepower to easily get 60FPS on max settings on 1440p and normally more with just high settings. \n\nIf you want too, [you can also do 4k gaming](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/QNDF68), though that will exceed your budget by quite a bit. \n\nAnyways, enjoy.", "T14 AMD Gen 2 launch is slated for this month.\n\nShipping is an open question, RTS versions generally ship within a week but there are horror stories of CTO machines taking forever and a half.", "Apparently the guy claims that Alder Lake will get some sort of competitor while others say that Warhol is cancelled.\n\nNot sure about this, the shortages aren't really hurting Zen 3 availability (at least in the UK, easy to get a Zen 3 CPU), AMD has quite a few 5nm capacity already allocated and most other rumor mill producers say Warhol doesn't exist. \n\nWarhol not existing and Zen 4 being late 2022 aren't compatible.

Will only mount on the front panel in the case, but you can move the fans so two act as exhaust on the top.\n* Motherboard: The ASUS B550-A has white components (vs silver on the ASRock), and Asus Aura Sync software syncs with Corsair iCUE via a plugin. Also has a BIOS flashback function in the event the motherboard was produced before Ryzen 5000 series launched, allowing you to update the CPU via USB (ASRock does not have this feature) as otherwise you need an older supported cpu to update the BIOS.\n* Memory: Crucial RAM has faster speed (same latency) as the Corsair RAM while being less expensive - still white with RGB.\n* Storage: switched to an m.2 NVMe with faster read/write speeds and a dram cache for the same money as the SN550.\n* Case: The Corsair 465x has a tempered glass front panel for a clear view of the 3 included LL120 fans, while still providing good airflow as the front glass panel has a large amount of space behind it for the front fans. I\u2019d mount the radiator in the top 2 fan positions, then move the 2 extra fans to top exhaust and the extra case fan to the rear position as exhaust. The case comes with a Lighting node core, so fine to control the aRGB on the 4 case fans not controlled by the AIO.\n* Power Supply: Normally I\u2019d say to just use a less expensive black power supply, but the PSU in this case is somewhat visible through the top of the PSU shroud - and you mentioned wanting a very white build. The Superflower psu is the least expensive white Tier A unit, and happens to have aRGB. 650w is more than enough for the system. I also added a set of white psu cable extensions to add to the white theme.\n* Other: the ASUS motherboard does not have WiFi, so added a WiFi card. If mounted on the last pcie slot, should be visually unobtrusive.\n\nOne last thought - you could go with a vertical GPU mount (like the Cooler Master vertical gpu mount v2) to show off the all-white gpu, but if you needed WiFi you\u2019d have remove the WiFi card and go back to the ASRock motherboard.\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/NvBQQD)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/g94BD3/amd-ryzen-5-5600x-37-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100000065box) | $299.00 @ Best Buy \n**CPU Cooler** | [Corsair H100i RGB PLATINUM SE 63 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/XzDJ7P/corsair-h100i-rgb-platinum-se-63-cfm-liquid-cpu-cooler-cw-9060042-ww) | $169.99 @ Corsair \n**Motherboard** | [Asus ROG STRIX B550-A GAMING ATX AM4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/y96qqs/asus-rog-strix-b550-a-gaming-atx-am4-motherboard-rog-strix-b550-a-gaming) | $162.99 @ Newegg \n**Memory** | [Crucial Ballistix RGB 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3600 CL16 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WPvqqs/crucial-ballistix-rgb-16-gb-2-x-8-gb-ddr4-3600-memory-bl2k8g36c16u4wl) | $109.99 @ Adorama \n**Storage** | [ADATA XPG GAMMIX S7 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/nJCFf7/adata-xpg-gammix-s7-1-tb-m2-2280-nvme-solid-state-drive-agammixs7-1tt-c) | $109.99 @ Amazon \n**Video Card** | [MSI Radeon RX 6700 XT 12 GB Video Card](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/FPnypg/msi-radeon-rx-6700-xt-12-gb-video-card-radeon-rx-6700-xt-12g) |-\n**Case** | [Corsair iCUE 465X RGB ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QTJmP6/corsair-icue-465x-rgb-atx-mid-tower-case-cc-9011189-ww) | $154.99 @ Amazon \n**Power Supply** | [Super Flower Leadex III ARGB 650 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/YzjNnQ/super-flower-leadex-iii-argb-650-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-sf-650f14rg) | $119.99 @ Newegg Sellers \n**Wireless Network Adapter** | [MSI AX905C PCIe x1 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax Wi-Fi Adapter](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/FsNgXL/msi-ax905c-pcie-x1-80211abgnacax-wi-fi-adapter-ax905c) | $39.99 @ Amazon \n**Case Fan** | [Corsair LL120 63 CFM 120 mm Fan](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4P448d/corsair-ll120-rgb-63-cfm-120-mm-fan-co-9050091-ww) | $29.99 @ Newegg \n**Custom** | [Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable/24pin ATX/4+4pin EPS/8pin PCI-E/6pin PCI-E PSU Extension Cable Kit 300cm Length with Combs, White](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/3TF48d/antec-power-supply-sleeved-cable24pin-atx44pin-eps8pin-pci-e6pin-pci-e-psu-extension-cable-kit-300cm-length-with-combs-white) | $29.99 @ Amazon \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $1241.91\n | Mail-in rebates | -$15.00\n | **Total** | **$1226.91**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2021-05-09 08:49 EDT-0400 |", "I have a 6700xt too, only saw grainy images either with the AMD image processing stuff or too much MSAA sharpening.

We just need 999 more. (this is a joke)\n\nBut you know if you think about it, it makes sense. AIB cards are heavily modified, sure they may have put in better components in some areas, but they can skimp in others if they need too so long as the parts are \"equivalent\". Equivalent in electronics is a funny thing as you can buy \"equivalent\" Chinese and Japanese parts which are the same on paper but not quite the same quality.\n\nAMD assembles the reference and puts it through quite a lot of development until it's ready for release. In comparison an AIB partner does not have the resources to verify that the changes they made to the card will work perfectly. They don't have the staff, the time, or the money. Small changes in electronic parts will lead to small variations in current that could affect performance. AIB cards change more than fans. \n\nIf AIB has the room to make a card better, then they most certainly can make it worse, which is how you end up with lemons from AIB partners, of which there are many examples. Right, you're not saying that all AIB partners are equivalent?  If AIB was always better, if they were equivalent and had to meet some sort of standard then this wouldn't occur, but it does, so there's clearly something wrong with your assumption that AIB cards are the same or even better.\n\nSo there is most defiantly a difference. AIB is supposed to be better, but that may not always be the case.\n\nI've discovered that you get more consistent performance and less issues when you buy the card that the software engineers are developing the drivers on, and this also makes sense.

We have no system specs and you're being very vague when you say \"I wiped it clean\" Wiped what clean? You re-installed only your drivers or you did a full OS re-install? If you re-installed your drivers, did you do a DDU uninstall or what? When you re-installed, did you do a driver-only install or what? Again, not enough details for us (the community) to give you a good answer to your \"question\" (it honestly sounds like you just want to be mad for the sake of being mad.)\n\nSecond, there is more to your GPU driver's performance than just your GPU. Since AMD Radeon Software (and Nvidia GeForce Experience as well) do more than contain just the driver on a default install, they require multiple system components to work \"properly.\" If you have a bottleneck in your system (say a slow SSD or HDD,) then those could impact your GPU's software package performance, resulting in a knock on performance degradation.\n\nIn addition to that, if you're running the software in Fullscreen (not borderless) mode, then that can also screw up the driver as well. Doubly so if you combine it with v-sync; it's usually better to just cap your FPS to your refresh rate and deal with any tearing. Just one of those nagging issues that got carried over from ye olde days of PC gaming. Even on my 3700X/32GB RAM/6800XT, fullscreen + v-sync is a complete mess and tweaks out the system; it's just one of those things. If you're going to ALT + TAB out of a game, just stick to Borderless + no v-sync; it'll save you a lot of headache.", "I also wanted to ask whether AMD has also a CPU temp monitor that you can recommend. Hehe", "**Overall:**\n\nSince Ryzen 3000 series, there really isn't a clear answer to that.Ryzen 1st and 2nd gen had worse single-core performance than Intel CPUs, therefore they performed worse at running most games, especially older ones, that don't utilize many cores/threads.\n\nWith Ryzen 3000 and especially 5000 series, that's no longer the case.\n\nI have been recommending Ryzen instead of Intel in recent years, even with the 1st and 2nd gen chips performing somewhat worse at gaming, because the AM4 platform had a much better upgrade path than Intel's platforms. See, even with 11th gen, they retain the LGA1200 socket but previous gen B460 motherboards don't officially support them (even though there aren't significant changes over 10th gen). And before that, there was also a platform change. So basically since Ryzen 1st gen and AM4 came along, Intel introduced 2 new platforms (LGA1151v2, LGA1200) and even chipset incompatibilities in a single platform. In the meanwhile, AMD used AM4 all the way and supported 1st, 2nd and 3rd gen Ryzen even on the most budget, oldest A320 chipsets, only the 5000 series requires at least B450 chipset motherboards (and new 500-series chipsets don't support 1st gen Zen CPUs as far as I know, never tried though).\n\nSo if you bought, say, an i5-8600 instead of a Ryzen 5 2600 back when they were new, and you were about to upgrade now, your only choice would be a 9th gen chip (which is not much of an upgrade) or a platform change to LGA1200. While if you got the Ryzen, you'd have the option to at least upgrade to a 3000 series chip right away (which is a considerable upgrade), or if you even got the B450 or X470 board with your 2600, then you could even upgrade to 5000 series now straight away while keeping your mobo.\n\nHowever, AM4 is most likely nearing its' end, not sure right now and too lazy to check for news but I believe 5000 series is the last Ryzen generation on AM4, so future upgrade path is not necessarily better at this point than Intel.\n\nFor that reason, it's whatever you find for a better price in my opinion. Consider that LGA1200 motherboards are generally a bit more expensive than AM4 motherboards, on the other hand, AMD Ryzen CPUs heavily benefit from high-end RAM configurations (3200MHz or higher is highly recommended), while Intel doesn't have those high needs, you can get away with 2400MHz RAM without significant drawbacks - and that's where you can just about make the money back that you lost on the motherboard.\n\ni5-10400F or 11400F are a great deal, for example, can be had for cheaper than Ryzen 5 3600 while offering similar performance.\n\n**Cooling:** AMD's stock cooler with Ryzen CPUs is hands down better than Intel's solutions, so that's another area where you can save if you don't want to overclock or make your PC completely silent.

It's a shame after all this time that there's still only two choices. There were more at one point (late 90s or early 00s). I was a Radeon person until I got serious about Linux and got tired of the really buggy drivers; nVidia always just worked.\n\nI'd certainly be pissed if I discovered this limitation only after trying to play a Windows game on a new/expensive Linux box.", "NVIDIA has the best raw performance under proprietary drivers, however, there are some compositors (such as KWin on Plasma) that do not work properly with it and require you to do some fiddling. You may need to turn on Force Composition Pipeline in NVIDIA X Settings if you want to get rid of the tearing at cost of small stutters. Sometimes, the driver won't behave properly and glitch out some graphical stuff, such as the text glitching out on some games from time to time or Vulkan render being so screwed up in others.\n\n  \nSince you are dependent on NVIDIA to fix them, it may take some time to, 1st get the driver into the beta and then some more time for it to be released as stable. Additional features, such as hardware acceleration for XWayland is missing, along with the 128 MB shader cache limit still being on, which depending on the game, it may cause it to stutter due to shaders being compiled unless you disable it with an environment variable. Also if you are on Optimus supported laptop, any driver version older than 390.xx forces you to use a much older method of getting the PRIME support going which can be a PITA to set.\n\n  \nTo me, the biggest difference is just how little I even need to think about drivers with my AMD card. Plug, play, and never worry about it anymore. It just feels like a completely natural part of my Linux system. Other than there being some stability issues with new AMD hardware, which makes sense, plugging in an AMD graphics card feels no different than plugging in a generic USB keyboard or mouse. It just works and behaves like any other natively supported piece of hardware.\n\n  \nWith my Nvidia graphics card, there always seem to be some weird quirks. I need to use strange workarounds and startup scripts to get basic stuff like a tear-free experience to work. I can't just set tear-free in my xorg.conf like I can with both Intel and AMD. I need to mess around with kernel parameters to get tty to work properly. I also see various weird graphical artifacts in my window manager every now and then with Nvidia cards. In general, configuring Nvidia cards and getting the configuration to stick between reboots is janky, finicky, and brittle.\n\nNone of this happens with Nouveau, but you know it ain't fit if you're looking to squeeze the performance out from your awesome NVIDIA card.

A company with so much money. They give money to other projects, but do not dedicate resources for proper driver for Linux. It should be just a nice hobby for the CEO.\n\nI dont have many issues with Nvidia while working in X11. Obviously Wayland is out of question now.\n\nI also don't like the Primus (two graphics cards) situation in Linux. Being forced to switch between graphics manualy is just plain stupid. It should work in the same way as on Windows.\n\nFor all these reasons i would rather buy laptop with AMD descrete graphics.\n\nThe problem is that most good laptops I buy, like the Thinkpad X or P series, uses Intel with Nvidia.\n\nIts a vicious cycle.\n\nWe need more laptops like MacBook from apple which uses AMD graphics.", "&gt;AMD has maintained a pretty consistent ~1.5 ratio to Xilinx regardless of how low it is pushed\n\nThe exchange ratio is 1.7234, meaning a pseudo-arbitrage opportunity is available so long as XLNX stock is worth less than 1.7234 times AMD stock. I say pseudo because true arbitrage is riskless, but the acquisition could still fall through, so there is risk. This is, incidentally, why the arbitrage opportunity is there at all- the market is pricing in the possibility of the deal falling.", "It's not being shorted, otherwise the ratio would have closed in on 1.72. If people believed the deal was likely to fall through, you would long AMD and short XLNX, increasing the gap further.", "I use a laptop with Nvidia dGPU combined with AMD CPU (Ryzen 5 4600H) with its onboard graphics, AMD Renior. I think I will probably fall into the category that will have the most issue with Nvidia since I am using optimus and using an AMD CPU (nearly all optimus related stuff is related to Intel). I would say they aren't that bad that people make out them to be but this doesn't mean that they don't have their own issues.\n\n* Wayland is out of the window for now.\n\nWayland native apps work on some compositors but XWayland does not and since most apps still rely on XWayland you can't use Wayland. Nouveau is out of the question here since your card doesn't even have the most basic functions on that driver.\n\n* The driver is not Free/Open source.\n\nThis is more of an ethics kind of problem. If you care about this than you shouldn't have bought a Nvidia card. But since you run Windows I don't think this would be a problem for you.\n\n* Optimus specific problems.\n\nWell you can ignore this since you are on a desktop but for the people that are interested, the situation has improved over the years but still has some problems. First of the most thing which is offloading a graphical app to the dGPU works perfectly with Nvidia's official method. This should satisfy most of the users that want to run Linux with Nvidia optimus laptops but there are some things that are broken such as:\n\n1. Reverse PRIME (using a display port that is connected to the Nvidia dGPU) does not work while you are running your Xorg on AMDGPU. (I worked around this by using a program called optimus-manager which lets me run my Xorg on Nvidia when I want to use my HDMI port)\n2. Some people have screen tearing issues but this is usually solved by enabling some kernel parameters are configuring the Nvidia driver.\n3. Power management is kind of a hit or miss with Nvidia dGPUs. On Windows while the dGPU is not being used Nvidia driver power off the GPU, on Linux Nvidia drivers puts the dGPU on a low-power state but does not power it off. There has been some progress on this but it only works with some Intel CPUs. You can workaround this by enabling some options in optimus-manager but it won't as convenient as it is on Windows. But for the most users out there this issue can be ignored since low-power state doesn't consume much battery and many wouldn't care.\n\n* Absence of va-api.\n\nMost of the main stream web browsers have added support for hardware video acceleration with the usage of this api but Nvidia does not support this. Since you are on desktop and probably have decent CPU to go with that GPU you can ignore this since acceleration can cause some issues and probably is not the worth the effort of setting it up on a desktop anyway since saving a little power doesn't matter on desktop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther than all of these you nearly get a driver that is on-par in the feature terms with Windows. Nvidia has great OpenGL/Vulkan implementation, releases its drivers for their newer cards at the same time with Windows so you get day-one out of the box support for them (unlike AMD). I think if you use a just-works distro or set it up correctly in other one you shouldn't have any problems.", "When I had NVidia with Debian Testing, I used to dread kernel and X updates, it would break once a year or so. Intel and AMD with their nice open drivers, just fit in and get updated normally with everything else.", "I used nvidia drivers on all of my builds exclusively since 2003 when I first switched over permanently to Linux as my OS.  I can honestly tell you that I've never had an problems with nvidia's drivers other than the occasional hiccups that were quickly and easily fixed with some tweaks to the Xorg.conf file or by updating the kernel.  A lot of people are sour on nvidia lately because nvidia has been slow and uncooperative with regards to Wayland support.  I now have a powerful AMD card and Wayland still has too many papercuts for me to use it as my daily display server.  There's no reason why you can't use Linux with nvidia and have excellent performance, at least on Xorg.", "Every CPU favours the fast ram. Go for 3600mhz.

I don't think that Debian should compromise on its policy regarding free software at all. At most, I think the non-free installation images should be given official status, as an equal alternative to the free images. But I think that Debian has the most mature and neutral approach to it.\n\nMy feeling is just that, when most users will need to end up using the non-free images anyways, you might as well not frustrate them. It's probably better for them to use Debian with the non-free firmware they need than to use another distro that doesn't cleanly separate the two at all. In that regard, all you really need to do is present the free and non-free ISOs on the site in an equal way, explaining the situation and detailing the hardware that requires non-free firmware. It's a way of letting users make their own informed decision, without compromising on Debian's values or otherwise changing anything beyond how it presents itself.\n\nI'd only somewhat disagree with your last point, that a project like Debian offers any pressure for vendors to supply open drivers. This is mainly because it seems like almost all open drivers and firmware that currently exist already aren't coming from manufacturers anyways, but they're coming from the community. Projects like &lt;https://github.com/qca/open-ath9k-htc-firmware&gt; come to mind, as well as the gulf between Nouveau and the NVIDIA binary driver, or the free AMDGPU (with RADV) versus the proprietary AMDGPU-Pro (with AMDVLK).

The only reason there's a special market for blobless machines is because blobless isn't the status quo anymore. It's depressing but that's where we're at.\n\nBut all that in mind, I still agree and think that Debian should care about keeping the OS blob-free. Debian is fantastic and I admire their principles, and I don't want them to change. But as long as the overwhelmingly majority of users will require non-free firmware, and as long as Debian is already making non-free images anyways, I think that it can't hurt to explain the situation prominently on the site when a user goes to download Debian, and to put the free and non-free images on equal footing, with the user making an informed decision on which to download based on their needs and desires.", "Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nI'll try that as a test, but to be frank, if AMD and Asus are claiming that the memory on the board is tested and supported, as provided by their specifications and compatibility lists,  then I'm not getting what I paid for. \n\nWhat's the point of publishing these build guidelines and spending their own money on compatibility testing if they wont support it?\n\nI've bought a second CPU to test which should arrive tomorrow, maybe mine was just in a bad bin.

Asus has consistent testing environments established regardless of individual models. One of these is the use of 1080p resolution. Because of this, Asus never has to explicitly state the usage of something like a 1080p resolution. The only time that they explicitly state the usage of a certain panel is if it is a *separate panel*. As mentioned above, this is generally done implicitly. This is the first time it has been explicitly stated. If it was just being scaled down, as in the case of the G15, there is no reason for them to state this, as in the G15's description. In addition, I think describing a \"WUXGA144hz LCD panel\" is a **very clear** distinction. In the description of the G15, mentioning the \"WQXGA 165hz panel\" is not talking about a panel that *might be* WQXGA, but also might be higher, and might be 165hz, but also might just be higher than that - they are saying that because the **actual panel, on the laptop, as in the panel that has been manufactured with certain specs, recorded in the individual tech specs, is a panel with maximum resolution of WQHD, LCD, and 165hz refresh rate**. In this case, they say \"WUXGA\"  because that is the literal panel used on the laptop's model. I'm not sure I've ever seen Asus use WUXGA/etc to refer to resolution, they actually explicitly state whatever the used resolution is. They only use it in the case of a panel, as is standard in the industry. Also, okay, let's say it really is the real panel except using a different resolution, despite the fact that doing that makes absolutely zero sense given all of our information about Asus, as well as the fact that they explicitly stated otherwise. But you can have the benefit of the doubt. In that case, why lower the refresh rate? They've never done that before on any review edition. Why would you specifically put a lower spec monitor on the portability, when you have a higher spec monitor you could put there instead? Given Asus's benchmark standardization, they could simply list the usage of the higher spec monitor and the fact that it's being run at 1080p is self-evident. Y'know; like what they've done with every single other laptop for the past few years? I don't know what other proof you'd accept if the fact that they explicitly write the panel description isn't enough for you.\n2. Yes, of course it's not legally actionable false advertising, nor am I implying that's a wise route to take. The fine-print stating that you can't use any released estimations or features as meaningful evidence is written in at least four different locations on Asus' website, as well as in the fine print at the bottom of every tech specs page - which I've already established that I've read through thoroughly.Regardless of what action can be taken, I think it's a pretty significant discrepancy that makes me feel pretty nervous about the new Intel lineup, and is something consumers deserve to know about. Once again: this is not their usual marketing bullshit. This could be deliberate due to pressure from Intel as they're pressured in turn by AMD's superior power-efficiency, or any number of reasons, but plain evidence shows that there's a lot to be cautious about on these laptop releases despite Asus' pedigree.", "My CPU is the AMD 7 3700X", "Notebookcheck.net for extensive reviews, including fan noise.\n\nUnless you plan on working inside a walk in refrigerator.....\n\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Microsoft-Surface-Laptop-4-15-laptop-review-New-AMD-processor-and-more-endurance.535914.0.html\n40~ dB range\n\nAsus\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ZenBook-13-Review-A-compact-13-inch-laptop-with-a-fast-Ryzen-7-5800U-and-OLED-display.537640.0.html\n37dB range\n\nVs ThinkPad X1 Carbon 4K\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Gen-9-Laptop-Review-Big-16-10-upgrade-with-Intel-Tiger-Lake.537905.0.html\n\n35~dB range\n\nVs ThinkPad T14s\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-T14s-Review-Business-laptop-is-better-with-AMD.485220.0.html\n\n32dB range", "For the games where it doesn't work, I don't think the issue is on AMD's side, but on Microsoft.\n\nThe Store apps are heavily locked down - most of them will not even allow the Radeon Overlay to show, which I suppose is due to some anti-tampering protection.", "So You\u2019re saying change back to an AMD processor?", "**Okay I found a help guide for the same issue with Minecraft.

Some small cases are not wide enough, because the second fan is over the RAM DIMMs and needs to be put in a slightly higher postion with some RAM DIMMs. Thats the whole issue with D15. Its the best, it beats every 240-280mm AIO and it got very silent fans to do that. But the case dimension requirement prevent it to be used in gimmick cases with stupid narrow wideness.\n\nIf you got a cheap board with awfull VRMs the D15 is allways the choice above any AIO cooler.

This is fundamentally a \"DLSS 1.0\" style implementation, it will need to be trained per-game (and probably per-resolution), and since RDNA2 doesn't have tensor cores they are also going to have to get good quality out of a very small net, small enough that running the net doesn't sap away enough shader time to offset all the performance gains from running at a lower internal resolution.  That's an additional challenge, not only are they re-implementing DLSS 1.0 (with all the shortcomings that had) but they are doing it with a much smaller net that will produce lower-quality upscaling, to make up for their lack of tensor cores.  And regardless of whether they add them in RDNA3, console hardware already locked in with RDNA2 for a while.\n\nit's also fair to raise the point that companies patent things all the time, and some of those approaches end up sucking so they never get seriously pursued, or get pursued for a while and then abandoned.  It may not even be what AMD ends up going for in the end.   \n\nBut with patents the optimal strategy is to file early and often - a couple grand and a few hundred hours of lawyer time on something that ends up not working out is way way better than letting someone else patent it first and getting locked out of your own technology.  Patents are no longer first-to-invent, it's first-to-file, so if tomorrow NVIDIA comes up with the same idea that you did and they file first then you can't use your idea anymore.\n\n(and specifically this patent was filed in November 2019 while DLSS 2.0 was publicly unveiled in May 2020, so AMD may have chosen to go with a completely different strategy in the meantime.  This strategy doesn't mesh with their statements about \"not requiring per-engine integration\", DLSS 1.0 style strategies require *very in-depth* integration and per-game training, so maybe they've discarded this strategy in the meantime.)", "Approval for the acquisition is pending.

AMD GPUs are a little harder to qualify, but if you already have an APU testing this with VAAPI acceleration might be worthwhile. Offloading transcoding from CPUs to a GPU will go a long way to reducing the bottleneck; you might not even need to upgrade your current CPU.\n\nOutside of transcoding, for the main Jellyfin software itself it's best to ensure you have plenty of RAM (for that many users, I'd say at least 8GB of RAM dedicated to the VM/server running Jellyfin) and keep an eye on it, increasing if needed.

There's not much point in going 8 cores unless you stream or need the extra cores for productivity tasks.\n\nThe CoolerMaster unit you picked is quite loud, and the fans are not 5V ARGB, but 12V RGB, so be aware the performance isn't quite the same as other coolers with better designs. The pump is a 3 pin connection, which means the speed of the pump is not PWM. CoolerMaster's RMA process is also... questionable. Their previous units were known to be leaky too, so I wouldn't recommend it overall. it is very well priced though...\n\nThe HyperX Fury is alright, I put a recommendation for a slightly faster unit from Micron. If you don't care about what memory dies you get and what latency and timing, then the Kingston RAM is fine.\n\nI would highly recommend the SN750 over the SN550 for the boot drive though. The lack of DRAM really hurts the SN550, though as a working storage drive it is great.\n\nI would highly recommend the newer Meshify 2 over the Meshify C - having used the older Fractal Meshify series (C and S2), I would get the updated series as the improvements are significant - far easier to service, and many problems were fixed. The Meshify C's top panel does not come off, which made it hard to work on, whereas the Meshify 2 Compact don't have this issue. The front panel changes (hinged, removable filter) also makes it far better.\n\nYour choice of PSU is what we in the hobby like to call \"The bomb has been planted\" units. Never cheap out on the PSU, or you'll find out the hard way what \"cheapskate pays twice\" means.

Get something reputable and confirmed to be good in components.\n\nWhile the Cooler Master SickleFlow fans are cheap and fine, I figured you mgiht want to check out a slightly more premium fans.

So maybe 5%. But because it has 33% more cores (6 vs 8) in applications that can actually use 8 cores it could be up to 38% (5+33) faster roughly.  But that's mostly just in video rendering, and things like that. In games it's hardly going to make a difference at all. You'll mostly be limited by your graphics card, especially on a laptop like you seem to be looking at. You won't see more than a 5% difference between the two in gaming.\n\nGHz aren't all the same either. A 4GHz CPU from 10 years ago is way slower than a4 GHz CPU today. Like less than half the speed. AMD's old CPUs were clocked to like 5GHz in like 2015, but performed worse than Intel 4GHz CPUs. These days an AMD CPU at like 5GHz is faster than an Intel one at the same %GHz speed, though, while using way less power. So that makes things even more confusing.\n\nIf you want to know the full potential of a CPU in the optimal settings with all cores being used fully, I would look up \"Cinebench\" scores on YouTube. Just make sure you're not comparing Cinebench R20 results to like Cinebench R15 because they use a different scoring system for some stupid reason. Also make sure to compare single core test to single core test, and not a multicore test to a single core test.", "\n### Basic Info: \n\n**Product name:**  LG 34WP65G-B 34-Inch 21:9 UltraWide Full HD (2560 x 1080) IPS Display with VESA DisplayHDR 400 and AMD FreeSync with Height and tilt Adjustable Stand - Black \n\n\n**Features:** \n\n\n* 34\u201d ultrawide fhd (2560 x 1080) ips display\n* srgb 99% color gamut with vesa displayhdr 400\n* usb type-c connectivity\n* amd freesync with 1ms motion blur reduction\n* 3-side virtually borderless display with tilt/height adjustable stand\n* Connectivity technology: HDMI\n\n\n\n### [Product image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41b9dsjoZ5L._SL500_.jpg) \n\n\n### Price History: \n\n**Highest price ever:** $408.76 \n\n\n**Lowest price ever:** $300.60 \n\n\n**Average price:** $377.84 \n\n\n**Previous price:** $398.32 \n\n\n**Current price:** $296.99 \n\n\n**Last price change:** -26% \n\n\n**Price change from average:** -21% \n\n\n**Price change from all-time low:** This is the lowest price ever! \n\n\nThe item was in stock as of 25/05/2021 08:17:28 (UTC) \n\n\n### [View the item on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RJ1BFJR?tag=denofdeals-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1)", "&gt;I went to one of the online benchmarking sites.

The Zen 2 3600 is decent but I would go to Zen 3 platform and get something that will remain powerful for years to come. 5600X and 5800X would work wonderfully, and I would recommend grabbing the 8 core 5800X (or 5700X whenever that comes out) as the industry is starting to trend towards using more multicore workloads. Zen 3's non-split cache really does make a big difference in their performance, and personally I wouldn't want to miss out on it, particularly for years.\n\nThe stock cooler is still pretty shit - the only one I would bother using is the AMD Wraith Prism, which only comes with the 3700X and 3800X. Unfortunately the 5600X gets basically e-waste of a cooler, and the 5800X doesn't even come with one.\n\nI would get a proper Noctua cooler, like the cheap as hell Redux 120mm tower, or the NH-U12S Chromax if you want a full black cooling finstack and fans. The NH-D15 Chromax.black is the big boy cooler that I would personally go with.\n\nI would recommend going to a smaller Mid-tower and regular ATX motherboard, because you just have far more connectivity, better compatibility and options, and it is cheaper. Why pay the SFF tax when you're just going to mATX? Either go full balls to the walls ITX or save your money and just get a small footprint Mid-tower.\n\nThe TUF Gaming B550-Plus is great, and I think it's worth it to get Wifi just in case you need it, but it isn't strictly necessary and it does come without it.\n\nI'd recommend picking up these set of Micron E-dies, they are far superior to your bottom barrel binned sticks. Just look at the difference in first word latency - 8.89ns vs 10ns! The price is so close that why wouldn't you get the better one? There is also RGB versions if you want to spend more but the memory dies are the same for non-RGB and ARGB.\n\nI would highly recommend grabbing the Samsung 970 Evo Plus while it is on sale, it's basically the best PCI-e Gen 3 NVMe you can get, and it's a steal of a price right now.\n\nI would recommend avoiding Gigabyte GPUs. I have one and I had to bust it open to replace all the shitty thermal pads and thermal paste just so my VRAM doesn't cook itself alive. EVGA has far better RMA program, more competent build quality and design, and better customer service and reliability. Just go with the best. The 3060ti shouldn't have the VRAM overheating problem that the 3080 and 3090 has... but it will still be rather warm unless your AIB has a good thermal solution, and EVGA's is at least competent in that regard. (ie. they didn't use absolute trash thermal pads that break down from heat and excrete oil)\n\nI really, really don't recommend that case, it's hot trash - quite literally. There's no real intake... take a look at the Phanteks mesh airflow cases like the P360A, the Fractal Design Meshify 2 Compact, and the Lian Li Lancool II Mesh. All of these have actual breathable front panels that won't make your intake fans meaningless, and they have far better build quality and design.\n\nThe PSU is also pretty hot garbage...\n\nhttps://linustechtips.com/topic/1116640-psucultists-psu-tier-list/\n\n&gt;Tier D \u2022 Recommended only for very cheap, iGPU systems\n\n&gt;\u2022 Thermaltake | Smart 80+ / SE / BM1 / BX1 (RGB) / DPS G Bronze X00W / 80+ RGB / M &lt;=650W / SP-P (X30W/650W) / German series Bronze (Pro RGB) - TR2 Bronze / S X50W / 80+ White / RX 80+ White / RX Bronze &lt;=750W - Toughpower DPS G Titanium 1500W - Litepower (RGB)\n\nWhile Thermaltake does have good PSUs, they also make trash ones, and you've picked one that I would never consider hooking a 30-series card to.

AMD has been delivering small quantiy of ryzen mobile. I personally expect even worse shipment of RDNA 2 Mobile. Reasoning: profit margin of GPU is abysmal comparing to HPC, consumer CPU + contracts with Microsoft and Sony.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The recently released MSI laptops with a 3050ti that are more expensive than some last year's 2070s worries me.\n\nPrices are all over the place. For examples, 3050Ti starts at 999\u20ac with Acer or 1239\u20ac with MSI in Germany. Asus and MSI charge laptops in Europe way more than in the US.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The only laptop with an RX5700M was the Alienware-51m R2. Since AMD's own processors was not compatible, it was paired with an Intel processor.\n\nNo, only Dell chose to have small shipment of RX5700M and they put it on MXM form factor for future upgradability of the 51m.  \n\n\nEdit: minor change in word choices.", "Apple should be moving to N3 in H2 of 2022. So Q4 2022 should see some serious movement of N5 sku's from AMD.", "I'm not sure if you're just going for an overkill build because you want to, but if that's the case, then the build looks good to me and there's nothing that I would really change, besides the RAM.\n\nNow if you want to get better value, for gaming, and save some money that could see better use in future upgrades that is an option. For example, if you buy a 5600x now, you can save quite a bit of money. When the majority of games (&gt;50%) in the future start making use of 8 cores more widely, you can use that saved up money to upgrade to whatever 8 core cpu will be available at the time. Why is this a better idea? Because a 5800x 8 core CPU will be slower than an AMD 6800x 8 core that will come out in the future - 6800x naming used just as an example, I don't know what they will be called. Exactly how an AMD 3600x is slower than a 5600x, even though they both have the same 6 core count. If this PC is primarily for gaming, and you don't have any productivity work that you would do to make use of the 12 cores of the 5900x, then you're spending almost double the money for very minimal increases in FPS, especially at 1440p and 4K. From what I remember, it's a 5% or so increase in FPS. My personal advice is get a 5600x, unless you need the 12 cores of the 5900x for something other than gaming. At 1440p and 4K, even a 3090 can NOT bottleneck a 5600x. For reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqmRvTz0kbA and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01EhbmJAW-k.\n\nFor the RAM, 4400 is too much. Past 3200mhz there are extreme diminishing returns when it comes to RAM speed. Additionally, I doubt you'll be able to get a 2200 FCLK stable for a 4400MHz RAM. AMD CPUs need to run in a 1:2 ratio relative to the RAM speed, and I've yet to see many people even get stable &gt;2000 FCLK, and you need to tune settings manually, so it requires some knowledge. If you want to try and get such high speeds, you're free to do that, I'm just mentioning this in case you don't have this information yet. My personal advice for RAM, don't go above 3600MHz, diminishing returns are extreme and you will be lucky to see a 1% difference in FPS in games. I noticed you said you plan to run it at 3800, but I don't see why you would buy 4400 RAM then.\n\nGen4 SSDs are not required for gaming, as games simply don't come anywhere close to using those kinds of speeds. You can also save money here and get gen3 SSDs. A guide if you would like to take a look: https://ssd.borecraft.com/SSD_Buying_Guide_List.pdf", "Since when ryzen mobile dominate in gaming?
