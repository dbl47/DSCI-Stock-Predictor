Do you just try hundreds of IDEs and programs? VoiceOver is a bit clumsy in my opinion compared to NVDA.\n\nI use Xcode as an IDE for developing apps for the Apple ecosystem and as an editor for developing other kinds of things, which is more or less what I used to do back when I had sight but instead of using Xcode as an editor I used vim on the terminal.  The only difference between now and back when I had sight is the way I mark large source files for navigation: Xcode has rotor settings such as jump to next error, jump to next breakpoint, jump to next mark, and jump to next function which are extremely important to me now.  You can access these settings by pressing Control+Option+Command+Arrows, where Left and Right moves you to the previous and next rotor setting while Up and Down moves you to the previous and next item.  Marks can be added to code by either using `#pragma mark` followed by a description of the mark in the C family of languages or by making a single-line comment with \"mark\" as its first word.\n\nI also use the terminal a lot, which is an old habit from my sighted days, and that too has extremely helpful keyboard shortcuts such as Command+Arrows where Up and Down moves you to the next and previous marks on the terminal, Command+U drops a mark on whichever line the cursor is positioned, and Command+Shift+A selects all the text between two marks, which by default are dropped on every command line prompt.\n\n&gt; How do you deal with missing semi colons, brackets and indentation when building your code?\n\nRegarding pairs of quotes, parens, brackets, or braces I just type both the opening and closing pair before typing the text inside, and have the option to do that automatically disabled in Xcode's preferences so I know exactly what I type.  Regarding semicolons (which I tend to forget after coding in Swift for a while) compilers do a pretty good job at reminding me.  Regarding indentation that's something you learn to live without, just like you learn to live without syntax highlighting, but if you truly need either you can press Command+Option+T or CapsLock+T (if you have CapsLock enabled as a VoiceOver key) and it will tell you the color of the text, the line number, and the indentation level including the number of leading spaces and tabs, and to make sure everything is properly indented for the sighted, you can select all the text in a source file by pressing Command+A after making sure that it compiles without syntax errors followed by pressing Control+I to re-indent everything.", "I'm 20/800 and a programmer and you'd be suprprised how fast I work (faster than a median sighted dev).

If you bothered to compare the tech bubble stocks\u2019 performance to other stocks\u2019 performance at the time, you\u2019s see that [days like this](https://imgur.com/dUiC3fE) where the bubble stocks have been dragging while other stocks were lit up, have way outnumbered days where bubble stocks have done as well as other stocks.\n\nHoly cow.

TSLA, NVDA, FB, ADBE, Currently holding 40x NVDA which is not making me any money.\n\nI have been theta-ganging TSLA by selling naked puts when it goes down (I have cash to cover), and writing covered calls when it goes up or during consolidation and it has been fairly profitable. I usually only do one or the other, and only 1x call so I am fairly well covered but luckily it has not  gone tit's up on me yet. But that doesn't really seem like the right way to do things unless you do want to hold shares of the company longer term....", "so with my current spread (510/505 puts expiring next week), my max loss would be:\n\n130 contracts x 500 (width of the strikes) = $65,000 if NVDA tanks to below 505 on expiration date since if someone has a 505 put and NVDA dropped to like 495 on expiration, it makes sense to exercise those puts. \n\nIf it lands in between, that's when I start to lose money, but my loss is capped at that 65k which only happens if it ends up below 505.", "Yup, all in on every spread till I make up all my losses. \nI do have some cash sitting on the side, but most of my buying power ($17k in the screenshot) is from credit received from the spread I entered. \n\nI can just double down and keep putting the earned credit into more spreads at the same strike, but I think the smart thing to do is wait for a drop to enter even lower OTM spreads.\n\nActually I had a 515/510p spread expiring this week that was ITM during the week and teetering close to that strike most of this week, but I knew it'd recover so I held. Bricks were shat a few, but I'm glad I held. I closed out that spread with like 90% profit today when NVDA kept on running upwards. If I held till tomorrow, I could've gotten an extra $2k more or so, but I'd rather enter a spread the following week at that point to avoid pin risk.", "With put credit spreads, I am defining my max loss and capping my max profit at the same time.   \n\n\nUsing your example:  \n510/500p 1/15 spread nets $250 (510p is $988, 500p is 738 for example, so 988-738=250 credit)  As soon as I enter this spread, $250 credit is added to my buying power, which I can use to buy stonk, deposit for lunch or just let it sit in the acct and do nothing.    \n\n\nIf NVDA drops from 530 to 520 early on after entering the position, the value of the spread goes up, say, to $400. We were credited $250, but if we wanted to exit this spread now, we'd be doing so at a loss of $150 per spread.  Since there is time for it to stay above 510,  we can hold on and hope theta decays at the price of the spread and hope that NVDA either moons or stays flat.  \n\n\nIf NVDA on expiration ends up below 500, the puts we sold will most likely be exercised, so max loss would be (510-500)\\*100\\*&lt;number of spreads&gt; which in our case is 1000.  Usual rule of thumb is to close spreads before expiration to avoid assignment after hours.   \n\n\nSummarizing very briefly here, but there are several scenarios to look out for with spreads, just outlined a few, but I honestly looked at youtube vids and browsed some threads on it on /r/thetagang, /r/options, and even older posts on /r/wsb from way back when it wasn't a cesspool of degeneracy.   \n\n\nI yolo my entire acct into it. So if I have $40k, and I'm doing a 510/500p 1/15 spread as my play, I'll do 40000/\\[(510-500)\\*100\\] = 40 spreads.", "No margin, its all my cash.\n\nIt was 40k last month but now that I'm up to 60k doing this strat, I'm all in on that 60k on spreads on NVDA (510/505p next week expiring).", "So this works well because NVDA is flat?"], "2021-01-01": ["NVDA is also over $500 a share and options costing $1,000-5,000+ for one contract.
