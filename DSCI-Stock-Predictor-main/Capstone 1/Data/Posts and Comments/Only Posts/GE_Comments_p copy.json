I\u2019m visiting GE October 29th for my birthday. I\u2019m wondering what attractions you deem it necessary to make a reservation for and tips on how to reserve and plan. \n\nRight now I\u2019m seeing no availability for Olga\u2019s Cantina \ud83d\ude1f\n\nIs it still really hard to get on ROTR?\n\nDo I need a reservation for docking bay 7?"], "2020-10-07": [""], "2020-10-08": ["'''\n\nIt\u2019s fine :). I moved there from Canada and the US and even people living there were like \u201cWHY would you leave Canada .....for THIS\u201d.  And that was my first impression of Germany and thought \u201cthis is how Germany looks?\u201d. \n\nJust a story for entertainment purposes:\n\nWhen I lived there, unemployment was at 21%. The houses across the street (Beckeradsdelle) from me were condemned because they were sinking into the mining tunnels below. The stores just outside of Buer were boarded up. I took the street car from GE to Bochum every day for my German course, which was full of asylum seekers that were forced to be there and didn\u2019t want to be, were always yelling and smoking in class (this was when you could smoke in buildings). My office was also filled with smoke.  I used to cry when i took the streetcar and would tell my spouse that it was scary - drunk people at 7 am; fist fights etc. and of course the Schalke fans. I was told I was too sensitive and over dramatic, surely it wasn\u2019t that bad. \n\nA year later we were leaving in BaW\u00fc and were watching some documentary or special interest show called \u201cthe worst public transit line in Germany\u201d (I don\u2019t remember the exact title, it was in German at the time but that was the gist) and it was THAT streetcar line.  I felt so vindicated. \n\nNow that I live in the south, I love defending the Ruhrpot to other Germans who have never been there but love to talk shit about how awful it must be. Sure, we had those conditions. But i maintain that it was the only place in Germany where I truely felt accepted with open arms and you cannot describe the spirit of the people there. They will always be MY people, even though i spent a very short amount of time there.\n\n'''\n\n[Context Link](https://reddit.com/r/germany/comments/j60job/comment/g7zas8l?context=999)\n\n[Go1dfish undelete link](http://r.go1dfish.me/r/germany/comments/j60job/comment/g7zas8l?context=999)\n\n[unreddit undelete link](https://unreddit.com/r/germany/comments/j60job/comment/g7zas8l?context=999)\n\nAuthor: /u/Adept_Palpitation737"], "2020-10-09": [""], "2020-10-10": ["I was feeling ok I had worn a bikini today in who knows how long.

I've opted to not have the alarm company continue their seriously overbearing/priced service, and had it terminated. I am still left with a number of IP cameras, and a couple of panels which I gather relay to the main panel. My question is this - I have one panel in my room that just sits mounted on the wall. It is linked to the internal network of the house (which I still have not cared to establish, as we have multiple hot spots and ran our own cat6's to the office, main bedroom, etc.) Is there any way to repurpose one of these panels to do something interesting/functional/cool...?

I'd just take it off the wall and ignore it, but there is an awkwardly placed 2\"x4\" hole in my wall where it sits, and I'd like to have it covered!

MBA has gained a lot of popularity in the last decade, and if done from a well-recognized institute, the career of an MBA holder seems pretty promising. An MBA program helps you build management and leadership skills that you carry for the rest of your life. \n\n**SNAP**\n\nSymbiosis is one of the finest institutes which offer MBA. They offer a variety of specializations and provide excellent exposure to their students. Symbiosis International (Deemed) University conducts an entrance exam called SNAP every year for admission. The [SNAP registration 2020](https://www.snaptest.org/) has already started.\n\nIt is a common entrance test for the 16 constituent institutes which offer MBA/PGDM courses. The exam paper consists of three sections-\n\n1\\] General English \n\n2\\] Quantitative data interpretation and data sufficiency, \n\n3\\] Analytical &amp; logical reasoning \n\nSymbiosis has introduced some significant changes in the entrance **exam for MBA 2020.** \n\n**Paper pattern**\n\nThe paper will consist of 60 questions which the candidate will have to solve in 60 minutes. They have scraped off the general knowledge section this year. Every right answer carries one mark, and there will be a negative marking of 25% for each wrong attempt.\n\nSNAP is an exam that tests your accuracy and time management. The difficulty level is not as high as CAT, XAT, or NMAT exams and if planned and prepared properly, the candidate can score well. This year the candidates can write this exam twice.\n\nIdeally, it is advised to start studying 3-4 months before the exam. While preparation, the candidates should solve previous year's papers and give mock tests. This help's in developing speed and accuracy. SNAP is conducted in 90+ cities in India. From these 90+ cities, students can choose up to three cities as a preferred location.\n\n**Eligibility Criteria**\n\nGraduates with a 50% aggregate (45% for SC/ST/PWD candidates) or equivalent from a recognized institute are eligible for this exam. Final year students can also apply. \n\n**Selection Process**\n\nAfter the candidate clears the exam, the institute begins the admission process. The next step of admission involves three more rounds. These rounds include a group exercise, personal interaction, and a written ability test. \n\nAfter the completion of these three rounds, the respective institutes finalizes a cut off for shortlisting applicants. The shortlisted applicants then receive a call for GE/PI and WAT. The final choice is made based on the academic studies, performance in GE/PI, and SNAP score.\n\nIf any candidate is planning to appear for this exam, ideally they should give both the attempts as best of both the scores will be considered. The students just have to pay the **SNAP registration fees** once for both attempts.

I have minis, a Hub Max, a Nest, some plugs that don't need a bridge (C by GE), etc.  I love being able to say \"hey google do X\" and it just works.  \n\nI'd like to start buying smart switches for my lights and ceiling fans.  I have a few issues that I can't seem to resolve though.  For example, my living room switch is three part: light switch for the ceiling fan light, rotating ceiling fan speed, hallway light.  And my hallway light has two other switches in the hallway (one single, one double tied to the front porch lights).  My bedroom is a two switch: ceiling fan lights and ceiling fan speed rotating knob.  \n\nMy question is: do smart switches exist for these scenarios?

Sometimes, the crash is severe enough that it does not find the monitor and a reboot is initiated after about 30 seconds (my guess is that the GPU fails, but then fails to restart).\n\nIt only seems to occur with certain games that are \"newer\" (Rust, Star Wars Battlefront II) but spares some games that are older (Company of Heroes). \n\nCiv VI was also a crash causer, but after lowering settings to minimum I haven't experienced any crashes (even though on max settings I run said game comfortably FPS, just unpredictable crashes). I can't seem to determine which individual setting could be the culprit.\n\nI adjusted the settings for other games with no luck.\n\nI have tried the following:\n\n\\-Ensuring the GPU drivers are the most up to date\n\n\\-Downloading and using nVidia GE Force Experience\n\n\\-Changing PCI Express -&gt; Link State Power Management to \"Off\"\n\n\\-Switching off Vsync\n\n\\-Switching to DX12 in supported games (and then back to DX11 after this didn't seem to resolve anything)\n\n\\-Virus scans\n\n\\-\"Rolling back\" drivers in the device manager, and then reinstalling drivers\n\n\\-Using DDU to remove all drivers in safe mode, and then reinstalling drivers directly from nVIDIA and not Windows update\n\nStill no luck.

He was even lucky to get ang chance of involvement after what he put me through for the last year of dating him. I am currently not dating him as he has a new gf now. I am unsure on how to deal with him since I am scared of him, I currently have him blocked after being a prick to me and my family and HIS family as well. But I am just unsure on what to do \ud83d\ude30\n\nSo I (17F) am currently pregnant, I am 22 weeks into it atm and the dad (21M) only recently found out about the baby. \nSo little backstory, I'm pretty sure some people might say that cause of our age I would be able to get him arrested but I cant do that where I'm from since 16 is legally the age of consent. \nBut when I was 16 and he was 20 we started dating just before the covid pandemic started and things were fine then, we were happy, playful, you know, all those things that happen at the start of a relationship, before the arguments. When the lockdown started to kick in we decided for me to live with him instead of with my mum so we would be together during lockdown. It was fine until problems started to rise, like, we would have to go shopping (usually really early in the morning) and there would usually be a very long line outside the shop, usually of old people. He would comment on how people were being \"selfish\" and not \"sticking to covid rules\" there was a time he said that he hoped all the elderly people just died so he would get what he wanted. But he would comment on how selfish people were being even tho we were doing the exact same thing they were doing. \nThere was also the time we had to take my cat from my mums because my mum had just gotten a new puppy and they weren't getting along very well. So we took on the cat and he would do nothing but complain and complain about how the cat was annoying because she mowed too loud or even purred too loud! Also the cat wouldnt use the litter tray and instead used his sink most the time to do her business.. whenever she did that I would clean it up but it still bothered him so since she was a outdoor cat he decided that when she had adjusted to the house he would kick her out the house to go outside and spend most the day outside. I had to start bringing her food outside to the door so she could eat because he refused to let her back in for more than 10 minutes. There was one night she was able to squeeze into the house through the living room window then I woke up to her right at my face purring and rubbing her head on me. I got up and decided to feed her then but then my bf(at the time) woke up and accused me of sneaking her in the house and waking him up. At one point she didnt come back for almost 2 weeks then when she did it looked like she was limping. I phoned my mum and told her and we were able to get her in to see the vet but my mum ended up going into the vet and me and my bf had to stay in her car and wait. He didnt like that, he didnt like having to wait 10 minutes for the cat to be checked by the vet so he basically threw a tantrum in the back of my mums car while she was in the vets, keep in mind hes 20 years old at this time. My mum came back with the cat and told us the vet said it had looked like the cat had been hit by a car and hurt her leg. Hopefully it wasnt too serious though, she got some medication and was told she had to stay indoors for at least 2 or 3 weeks. When we got back to my bfs home we started arguing about how he wanted to kick her out the house again but I woudlnt let him because her leg was injured! But he didnt understand that and just said \"shes a animal, they're suppose to be outside, they dont need to be indoors at all\" we argued for a while until I phoned my mum in tears telling her that we couldnt keep the cat anymore, she was able to take her back. The cat and the dog actually started getting along when she got back to my mums house and her leg fully recovered by the way. \nAnyway me and my bf would have sex, usually daily or whenever he wanted to. After a while it just kinda felt like I was doing a chore tbh.. but I was suppose to be on the pill during this time but I wasnt because my bf said it should be all natural and if I got pregnant then that would just be destiny.. (i know now how stupid i was to believe him and do what he said) after being with him for about 6 months I started to have break downs, I would randomly start crying about anything and I just felt anxious all the time, so I decided to get help. I phoned my doctor and asked if I could speak to a mental health nurse. I got this lovely woman I would speak to her on the phone about things then when I told her there was somethings I felt that I wasnt safe saying over the phone while at my bfs house she was able to get me a face fo face appointment to talk to me about things af my bfs. I told her about what it was like, how I felt, and she did a kinda test with me, just like asking questions and at the end she ended up telling me I wasnt in a very healthy situation. As I had told her that he had threatened to slit my throat before if I decided to leave him and that he had said that if i ever got pregnant then I would be stuck with him(again, I know how stupid I was for ignoring the obvious warning signs) but she told me that I was In a toxic relationship and that I needed to leave. I was thinking about it, but was too scared to do it at the time.\nRound about this time my mum messaged me saying she wanted me round at hers cause she wanted to tell me something important face to face... I was able to get permission to go to my mums alone(yes I needed permission to go places alone). I got to my mums and she broke the news to me that my gran was found with cancer and that it was terminal so there was nothing they could do to help her.. my gran had been getting painful headaches for months by this time and we didnt know what it was. She was getting tested loads. And a lot of her appointments had to be delayed due to covid. They didnt find the cancer until her last scan, a fully body scan were they found it all over her body.. it had spread so much that it was everywhere.. it was heartbreaking for me since I had never lost a family member before so it would be the first death of the family for some of my family members.. \nSo I got back to my bfs and told him the news, he did comfort me for a bit and i layed in bed all day the next day but then the day after he just accused me of being lazy and was using my grans illness as a excuse to not go outside and exercise (we usually went out for daily walks..) when in reality I was just really upset about my gran.. \nabout a month passes and my gran only gets worse.. we get told she has months, then we would get told she had weeks then to be told she had days until eventually being told.. she only had hours left.. \nI was at my mums house that day with my bf, there was a few family members there(and yes I know we shouldnt have been around eachother but this was about the time my family partly didn't believe in covid) \nAnyway, I was sitting on the floor, my bf was next to me and my other family members were on the couch. All of us were drinking. Then my mum got a call.. was a nurse that told my mum that my gran had sadly passed away... I lost her on August 14th 2020.. the last time I ever saw her she broke down crying because she didnt feel comfortable being around my bf..\nWe all drank for most the night until 1am.. me and my bf started walking home and of course he decided to have a go at me about how bad my family was and that he didnt like my older brother because he looked at him weird.. we got to his and I snapped. After him yelling at me, I just got up and walked out his house. I wondered my town for a while, alone(I was drunk as well) my mum messaged me, my bf messaged me, he wanted me to \"come home\" so eventually I went \"home\", I walked to my mums house and stayed there, (everyone else was asleep by this time) my bf was messaging me still telling me to \"come home\" to which I replied \"I am home. I'm at my mums house\" he blew up about how I lived with him and not my mum anymore we argued, he phoned me and we basically just yelled at eachother for ages. At some point, idk why but I decided to let him come to mine and I decided to stay with him again.. after a bit we were told about my grans upcoming funeral, that my bf was not invited to. He was NOT happy. And u guessed it, moore arguing \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 the day before the funeral I broke up with him (I think it was just before the funeral that I actually got pregnant as well) \nA few days after the funeral I did end up going back to him because I was in a vulnerable place..\nWas with him for about a month, pubs had just opened back up at this time and ge would take me to the pub, even though I was underage. I never had a drink there, I would just sit in the pub and be quiet while he got drunk and had a laugh with the people there. There was a employee at the pub that knew me and my age but she never kicked me out, they just let me stay because I was so quiet. \nThen came the day of the last break up. He went to the pub and I went home because I felt tired. I was just about to go to sleep when he starts asking if I want to go out with him and his friend in the car (his friend was gonna be driving but he also didnt have a license so it was a horrible idea) I said no at first but then he just kept begging.. I gave in.. after about a hour of driving around town, police started to catch on that we were going around town. I started getting scared and i was having very bad cramps at the time(I now know that that was a sign of me being pregnant since I was also late at this time) I wanted to go home but we couldnt stop the car because the police were chasing us. I started crying.. and that escalated into my bf calling me a piece of shit and a pussy and that I was scared of pigs.. I was scared of police, I didnt want to get charged or anything.. we ended up in another town, once losing the police we ditched the car. I had never been in this town before so I didnt know where I was and I didnt have my phone with me as well. At one point my bfs friend ran away from us and we lost him. We were wondering the street then the police spotted us and my bf was pretty well known by the police so they knew he was involved. Asked us questions, he stupidly said he recorded the police chase on his phone so the police took his phone off him for evidence. The police left us after he told them where the car was hidden and we were stranded. No phones, no way of getting home. We argued and once again I snapped and decided to walk away from him and leave him. Police later found me and kindly gave me a lift home. \nThe police asked me questions and asked for a statement, which I gave then they dropped me off at my mums house. They then advised me to stay away from my bf because he was nothing but bad news. I later broke up with him and blocked him on everything cause I knew that if I didnt block him then he would either harass me or try to get back with me again. I was proud of myself. \nBut then..\n10 days later I was speaking to the mental health nurse again and I told her that I was worried I was pregnant because I was about 2 weeks late. So she bought me a pregnancy test and I took 2 of the tests. Both came back positive.. I was scared, I felt alone, i didn't know what to do.. i did later figure it all out and for about a month or 2 i was deeply in the mindset of abortion but then i told my mum that i was pregnant and she was fully supportive about it.. I was so happy.. I decided to keep it because I was was gonna get help and support through it all. If I never told my mum then I probably would have aborted the baby. Round about December time I got my first scan and I think I was 17 weeks by that time? We then decided to post on Facebook about my baby and people were happy and excited for me \ud83d\ude0a\nI also decided to tell my ex's mum because she wouldve been the \"other gran\" so I decided to let her get involvement to be part of her grandchild life. Her and my ex dont really get on that well as well. But I felt her know and she was grateful that I decided to tell her rather than not let her be involved at all. She is a sweet woman. At 20 weeks I got to find out my babies gender and was told it was a girl! I had names in store for her by this time anyway. I decided on alexis for her name and I wanted Elizabeth for her middle name because it was my grans name and since she never got the chance to know about a future great grandchild it meant a lot to me. But at 21 weeks I decided to put my scan pictures at my cover photo on Facebook and my ex's friend saw it and asked who the dad was. I told them who it was and they told my ex. By this time I expected him to already know about the baby by this time and thought he just didnt care since by this time he had a new gf and was getting involved with police and other stuff. But he was able to get in contact with me and asked if it was true. I said I was and explained the situation and how I had dealt with everything and how I had put in for my own place and how I had put in applications for money so it would help me. He said he wanted involvement so I decided to give him 1 chance to change his ways and prove he could be a good dad. He was doing good at first, he poured his last drinks down the drain and started looking for a job. Me and him started talking again and he was being nice at first and just asking questions about the baby. He then asked if he could get stuff for the baby and I told him to \"hold off\" from getting baby stuff since I was getting stuff given to me from people for free and I would let him know when I have everything, if I needed anything else cause I didnt want too much stuff. He said \"yea that's fine\" he then asked about names. I told him that I had already chose a name for the baby and he was fine with alexis. What really got to him was the fact that HIS name wasnt gonna be part of their name. I told him I would \"think about it\". I then notice his gf posting about wanting to take selfies with babies and how she couldn't wait for it. Which pissed me off cause I saw it as if she thought she was gonna get to take a selfie with MY baby as if it was hers! My ex was the same. He was posting about how he couldnt wait to meet her and how he was gonna spoil her and his friend made a joke about how police would be at his door from her crying during the night. I then told him that he wouldnt get to see her everyday, just some days. I said I would be busy somedays anyway, his response to that was \"well then when ur busy, I'll just take her\" I ignored him after that. Next day we were talking and at one point I didnt reply to his message. So he got mad and decided to post on Facebook about how much of a selfish person I was and how he wasnt allowed to get his \"little princess\" clothes that said \"daddies little princess\" even tho I never said that because i said that he just had to \"hold off\" from getting stuff and i would let him know if i needed more. I decided to comment on his post because of the comments he was getting from people supporting HIM(someone even told him to get legal help) I commented saying what really happened and how he did all this because I didnt reply to his message! He then told me that he should've been the first person told about the baby. I blocked him again after that. He then had a go at my mum and said \"how dare you post on ur Facebook about MY BABY\" she ended up blocking him as well. \nI later found out he had been drinking as well. \n\nSo now I'm here, in my bed contemplating what I should do about the situation cause I know hes not gonna stop there and he will try to do something else. I'm not sure what but itll be something. Is there any advice anyone has?

He never did until one day I was on the bus from school and he calls me to come meet him at his friends house and i did not want to go because i didn\u2019t want to sit around while his friends did drugs. this made him very angry. so my dumb ass goes anyway. By the way i lost a friend over this.. I see him he grabs me by the arm and continues to yell at me in public telling me what a c***t i am for not meeting up with him sooner. Threatening to fight anyone who looked at us.\nIt was bad.\n\nAfter that day our relationship went down hill. we fought every day because he would just get so angry at me for no reason.\n\none time we ordered food from this place. His got a borrito that had lettuce in it and apparently i ordered him lettiuce on purpose to get him mad. Threw the burrito on the floor of his disgusting room and talked about how i should know he don\u2019t like lettuce. Ok.. another time i ordered my self sushi. asked if he wanted anything. he got chicken and rice. got mad at me because the chicken and rice tasted like sushi and apparently that was my fault.. Also threw that out, meanwhile i\u2019m paying for all this crap.. also he was very dirty and lived in dirty.. \n\nMany occasions he would show up at my job screaming and embarrassing me. i had to tell them to tell him i was not there...  idk why i dealt with it. i wanted to leave but i was so scared. i actually thought he was gonna kill me if did. \nhe ended up getting bed bugs and i bought him all new sheets and blankets  and didn\u2019t even get a thank you. \n\nthen one day a miracle happens and he breaks up with me... HE BROKE UP WITH ME. and i just thought to myself. i\u2019m finally free... even though he didn\u2019t not \nnecessarily physically abuse me. what he put me through i do not wish on anyone.. \n\nhe did try to ge back with me and even texted me once asking me if i was gonna tell everyone we ate back together .like huh?

A potential solution I thought of was to bring back item lending services originally released not too long after the backup which 2007scape is built on (the service itself was even announced in 2007, albeit in December).\n\nAs a mid-level player myself, and one who is TERRIBLE at pvm, I had a hell of a time going for my fire cape even with the pre-nerf blowpipe. If mid-level players had the option to, say, rent a twisted bow for 24 hours to do fire cape attempts if they have the coin to finance the rental, then the pushback on nerfing the viable mid-level items may not be as big. It would also provide higher level players the opportunity to make passive income off of gear they aren\u2019t currently using. \n\nMy idea is to bring back the trading posts which were placed in every bank near the start of OSRS as lending posts instead, allowing players to search for items in an interface similar to the GE, and then seeing a list of players currently lending the item, the price they are charging, and for how long they are lending the item in an interface similar to the house advertisement board.

So, when offered a chance to enjoy a good old homebrew of dark heresy mixed in with Wrath and Glory, our RP group was quickly formed and jumped at the chance of starting what our anonymous dm promised to be an all guardsman party experience, but so much more epic. We spent the day rolling up our characters, building up our backstories, and at the end learned that we would all have our personality and lore knowledge \u201ctransported\u201d into the 41st millennia to play as our newly made characters. With that the whole entire group were made into Isekaied protagonists of the most infamous, murder your main character like series, that would make even Game of Thrones blush in envy. We were all allowed to take a couple of items or special abilities with us that our main characters would have on their person, a so-called blank check that the God like being responsible for our transportation, was graceful enough to give us before having us murdered brutally in the meat grinder. This could have been anything from a lightsaber, a demon blade from Devil may cry series, superpowers, to a heretical Eldar waifu pillow. The potential was as endless as the horrible deaths that awaited all of us in this nightmarishly dystopian future.\n\nSo that is how we started, as a recently established team of inquisitorial acolytes with meta knowledge of the setting aboard the Divine Devotion, a pristine Sword class inquisitorial vessel heading straight to the lovely hive world of Necromunda. There was Lord Daimen Everbright a noble psyker straight out from Holy Terra, Mok Glok a Viking looking feral worlder with a lawgiver gun acquired from the judge dread universe, Rajah Mills a battle hardened weapons specialist who was \u201cawarded\u201d his very own Chimera APC, and two death world Kriegsmen who decide to play up their characters cultural customs. By that I mean they went so far as to wave around their shovels every couple of minutes and refer to themselves by their numbers instead of their names. There was 11 and 36, with the latter\u2019s avatar being a girl. With such a delicious background it was no surprise that the interrogator in charge of our group turned out to be another death worlder straight out of Krieg, one going by the name of Colonel Addas, whose love of jumping straight into combat could only be matched by his mighty shovel. Above Colonel interrogator Addas we had his proactive superior, aka our superior, a full blooded, honest to the god emperor, with all the honors that accompanied it, inquisitor who also has a love of gas masks. Minus the silver hair, her getup made her look a lot like Bertha from resident Evil operation racoon city, so we all decided just to call her Inquisitor Bertha. \n\nNow aboard Inquisitor Bertha\u2019s light cruiser, our group of isekiaed misfits where introduced to the mission that would take place on a planet known for its marauding population of highly violent gangers. And by introduction, I mean a quick debriefing that took place inside Inquisitor Bertha\u2019s personal interrogation chambers. It was a dark 20 by 20 cell with enough highly polished torture equipment, chains, and an operating table to let us get a picture into what sort of inquisitor we were placed under and what would happen if we failed. God-Emperor preserve us, the woman and her death corps interrogator revealed a dire tale that involved low level gangs within Necromunda acquiring weapons that were manufactured and \u201cblessed\u201d by the forces of chaos. It was now our job to locate who exactly was manufacturing these weapons and make sure that it ended before the whole entire Hiveworld was filled to the brim with a daemonic horde of drugged crazed gangers that not even the small planetary detachment of Imperial fist space marines would be able to stop.\n\nNow our options on how to handle this holy mission was railroaded into one of two options, the first involved one team getting the honor of going into the under hive to swim among the poor wretches of Necromunda society and attempt to discover where those chaos weapons were being made while not having our souls ripped out to feed the dark gods or stabbed over having shoes not made of the discarded wrappers from the local ration bar brand. The second path involved us going into the well-kept, clean hive palace of the planetary nobles to enjoy food, music, and luxury of a far higher standard than we were all used to while dealing with the dangerous environment of political back stabbings in order to locate a possible connection with the ruling families and the sudden surge of chaos weaponry. Lord Daimen, with eagerness, cunning and absolute bravery decided to volunteer the group to handle the nobles, an easy and comfortable avenue that the high born pysker could easily navigate through and prevent us from falling into any political pitfalls. Unfortunately for our overly posh noble, Colonel interrogator Addas demanded the honor of leading us into the greatest region of gang based violence to hunt down answers and die in the name of the emperor while Inquisitor Bertha\u2019s more senior entourage could handle the dinner parties and all of the things that the death worlder found to be a cowardice waste of time. Of the two it seemed Inquisitor Bertha found the death worlder to have a more persuasive tone than our common sense driven high born psyker, a great regret for all of us.\n\nAnd so that is how our group found ourselves within a heavily armed and armored personal carrier, navigating our way through one of the most dangerous places in the galaxy second only to a death world, the eye of terror, and wherever the hell the tyranids came from. As our group sat in awkward silence for a bit longer than any of us wanted, Rajah recommended that the group get in contact with the local Arbites and see if we can find some information relating to our mission from them. A smart tactic that even our interrogator begrudgingly agreed with since we could probably end up fighting cultists sooner with some Arbite support, than spend hours trying to find a giant metaphorical flashing sign offering to sell chaos weapons in exchange for your immortal soul.\n\nOnce we parked our APC right outside the nearest arbite station, our group marched in united and confident enough to attempt whatever great undertaking had presented itself. As the group interrogator shows his inquisitorial rosette, before marching through the precinct\u2019s halls, our Krieg companion going by the number of 36 had to excuse herself to use the little interrogators room. Immediately our group went and split up, with the rest of us marching straight into the office of an Arbites Sergeant. A grizzled battle hardened Arbite who had seen a lot of things, but never did he expect to see the Emperor\u2019s holy inquisition barging into his office.\n\nUpon meeting this veteran Arbite, we requested some information regarding the gang wars and the discovery of the taint of chaos, a matter that even the Arbites seem to have taken an interest in. Though their full might was reserved on dealing with the larger gangs that inhabit Necromunda\u2019s low hive levels, the news that small gangs were given warp touched weaponry and running amok destroying other small gangs and swallowing them up was quite interesting. Two among these gangs seemed to have risen quite high for a time, the Van Dimes and Graffters, the first being a firearm obsessed gang and the latter being some back alley tech fetishists that attempted to style themselves as ganger Tech Priests. The damage these two gangs caused was so horrid and ritualistic that the Arbites where planning to mobilize in full force to deal with them. That was until a third gang came out of the blue and absolutely wiped out the savagely barbaric chaos touched gangs, with what the arbite specialists claimed to involve low yield melta bombs and well positioned vantage points. The absolute level of damage that was inflicted upon the Van Dimes and Graffters was to such a point that the few survivors preferred Arbite custody than to remain on the streets to be hunted by some secret group.\n\nWe used our most talented inquiry tactics to get more information from the Arbite regarding this third gang, but as soon as we learned that they were calling themselves the Cabal, some of our more lore friendly 21sters started sweating out bullets. The Cabal of the Warhammer lore involved a massive group of immortal xenos united to stop chaos at all cost\u2026 and that cost involved Chaos taking an extremely dependent control of humanity, which would then result in mankind plunging itself into an extinction war which would also doom Chaos to follow soon after us. That was the plan of some insanely retarded aliens, who we all began believing that they had somehow escaped Eldrad\u2019s genocidal fury, and have now returned, creating chaos gangs, then hunting them when they failed to meet whatever evil plan the Cabal had going for this poor planet. Immediately we all started to ask a series of questions on where we might be able to find this Cabal gang, and where the Arbites suspected these heretical weapons were coming from, but an issue of cultural differences soon came to the forefront.\n\nYou see the Arbites of Necromunda are heavily pressed on every side, just like the imperium at large, many heroic figures had thrown their lives at stopping the gangs and mutants of Necromunda from causing massive damage and all out panic on the planet with little in the ways of proper compensation. So every bit of information and clues gathered by the Arbites were to be kept safe and protected in the case it reaches whatever gang the Arbites planned to deliver the Emperor\u2019s justice upon, that is of course if the gang in question decides to repent and offer a nice donation to the fine men and women of the Necromunda\u2019s branch of the Adeptus Arbites. This lowly Sergeant of the Arbites had offered much in the way of free information, but anymore would spit upon those proud colleagues who could not be here today and so demanded tribute in their place.\n\nWe as a collective group looked at the literal living pay wall before us, who silently extended out an open palm waiting for the grease that the all-important squeaky wheel needed. Most turned to Lord Daimen, our resident noble, AKA money bags, only to learn that our group nobleman was just as poor as the rest of us. When we questioned how that had happened, we found out the Nobleman had paid off some Adeptus Adminstratum clerk to quickly requisition his current war gear. The first being the Emperor\u2019s wrath manifested in the form of a normal human size bolter and the second being an ancestorial sword of the Everbright Family.\n\nDaimen called it Brightflame, it was something quite precious to him that had just been returned to the hands of the Everbright\u2019s after a millennia\u2019s time long thought lost. One crummy sword that looked more like an antique piece that you hang on the wall instead of the murder tool you need to survive in the 41st millennium. Yet, this serpentine, gold hilted, black blade was some trinket that his avatar\u2019s noble family had lost, only for the damn thing to be found in some dusty armory, that Daimen had just ran across during his time in the Vostroyan First born. A literal week before his character had been recruited into the inquisition. To make matters worse for he who we all thought to be the wallet of the group, the damn nobleman hadn\u2019t been paid since joining the inquisition, whose organizational belief in their acolytes surviving their first mission was so bleak none of them needed to be paid until after the mission was over.\n\nTaking a deep sigh the group collectively turned away from Lord Daimen and stared at Colonel Interrogator Addas, who getting the hint, started to rummage through his coat pockets looking for some thrones. As the Interrogator went about this, Lord Daimen had a sudden sensation of inadequacy, him a noble child of terra, a representative straight out of the cradle of humanity\u2019s elite, a psyker with might of untold power, and a mortal of the 2nd millennia with more meta knowledge than the rest of us, was unable to help his poor peasant companions accomplish our much needed goals. That was something that tore at Daimen\u2019s very fabric, his nerd like ego must have raged to such a point that it may have caused a new warp predator with an extreme dislike of failure to come into existence and haunt the posh princeling. Just as the Interrogator Addas pulled out a nice little bribe, Daimen strode forward, beaming with determination, attempting to \u201csave the day\u201d by persuading the Arbite sergeant with a heartfelt speech focusing upon his honor, his sense of civic duty, and desire to see him become the shining beacon of virtue that the great imperium needs by giving us that information for free. What happened next would be placed forever upon the poor poor foolish nobleman who for an instant forgot what universe he was sent to. We all looked at the veteran Arbite who just took a moment to contemplate what he just heard, before shaking his head and offering a heart filled smile, soon followed with him extending out his other palm for double his original asking price. You know to help him find some honor and be able to afford the expense associated with becoming that shining beacon of virtue that all within the Necromunda\u2019s branch of the Adeptus Arbites could come to respect.\n\nSeeing this our Interrogator strode forward with his own smile hidden behind his gas mask, cutting off anything else that Daimen had to say, and reached into his pocket for what we all thought would be another bribe. Instead the Krieger manhandled the massive Arbite, pulled out a heavy stub pistol and placed it underneath the chin of the Arbite Sergeant, all while being inside of said Arbite\u2019s office, which was inside of a heavily armed precinct, deep in the under belly of the infamous, *people such us as go missing all the time*, Necromunda Hive city. The mad Krieger in his most respectable and politely tone, first asked Daimen to put up a sound proof barrier, then offered an even more compassionate request this time to the Arbite to share his juicy info on the Cabal, but things are just not that easy. Never may one say that the Arbites, the lords of Order, the enforcers of the Emperor\u2019s laws, would ever be cowed by threats to their lives. No, this was a seasoned Arbite who had seen to the judgement of a hundred and thirty-nine criminal gangers within his first month on the force. He had fought scrap metal infused criminals and seven armed mutant abominations on a biweekly basis, why would some uppity yahoo from some nuclear radiated dump have the right.. NO.. the damn audacity, to dare threaten the LAW. With a short speech far more intense than that of Lord Daimen\u2019s, the Arbite Sergeant made it clear that we would not get shit from him and that we would be absolutely crazy to think that the Interrogator could kill him and ge\u2026.. BLAM.\n\nWe all looked in horror as the Arbite Sergeant crumpled lifeless down onto the ground while our absolutely insane interrogator walked with his blood splattered gas mask over to the late Arbite\u2019s console to look for what information he needed. As the information transferred onto his data pad, the rest of us looked on as the interrogator threw half of his gun into the garbage chute of the deceased Arbite before rushing off stealthily to throw the other half into a far off chute. As he returned, we all decided shit was about to hit the fan and we needed a distraction big enough to get us all safely out of here and into our APC. Daimen Everbright again decided to offer his aid, this time swearing there was no way he could fail at all and decided to use a special ability of his that he got once entering into this Grim Dark Nightmare. Within his psionic arsenal, a new, never before ability of Technomancy was added into the grim dark future of mankind. An ability that not only allowed Daimen to speak with the children of the Void dragon, but also to outright command the machine spirits to do his bidding. What some of us hoped to be Daimen\u2019s finest hour was shockingly awarded with what could be a flash bang of disappointment, a literal, just angered the machine spirits so they decided to erupt every light panel into a massive stun the shit out of you flashbang cocktail of a distraction. Also, they informed Daimen that all of the prisoners within the precinct were released, without any of the stations defense systems to stop them. \n\nSo there we were, a couple of morons from another universe, who just had a flash bang of a technical distraction blasted straight into our faces, a dead veteran Arbite that our absolutely insane interrogator just murdered a couple steps away from us, and the whole entire station now under attack by rampaging cultist gangers that we let loose upon a handful of guards who normally dealt with a prison riot by flipping a switch to activate a defense system\u2026 that just didn\u2019t feel like it would be appropriate to turn on today.\n\nAttempting to toughen through the stunning blast, most of our group succeeded, but Rajah was the only one of us too incapacitated to do anything. Mok Glok and number 11 quickly decided to carry Rajah, allowing our group to take this opportunity to rush straight out of the Arbite Sergeant\u2019s office and directly into a squad of Arbites armed with automatic shotguns. Turns out having your light bulbs switch professions into a flash grenade was not something the Adeptus Arbites found to be legal within the lex Imperialis, so the ticked off Arbites decided now would be the time to bring violent justice upon any suspicious characters that just so happened to get in their way. The first ones they came across just so happens to be the group that had a blood stained kriegsman officer, a psyker, and two dangerously looking armed men carrying a moaning guardsmen who was screaming out that we are all screwed.\n\nThinking fast on his feet, and putting as much deceit that a high ranking noble like him was famous for, our little lord Daimen somewhat redeemed himself by pointing in a random direction and screaming out \u201cHeretics, we are under attack by Heretics, they murdered the Sergeant, quickly dispense the Emperor\u2019s justice.\u201d To our surprise, Daimen\u2019s the most, it actually worked, with the squad of Arbites running off in all directions looking for a murderous heretical scumbag that just gunned down their shining beacon of departmental hope. With little else stopping us, we quickly rushed through the Arbite station, down several flights of stairs and stayed away from any hallways that explosions and firefights occurred in. As we navigated through the absolute chaos, Daimen decided now would be the best time to again use his Technomancy ability to ensure no video recorded evidence of our visit existed. What should have been a terrible idea that failed epically and earned the Noble the most degrading nickname that the rest of the group would have him wear until the emperor walked off his golden throne and said otherwise, was instead given another surprisingly successful twist of luck. The result of his Techno-magical command resulted in every bit of our time in the precinct being deleted with all backup vox vids being sent directly into interrogator Addas\u2019s data pad without a trace to link us to this whole entire mess. With what little Subtlety left intact, we all made our way out of the precinct, down onto the streets, soon packing into our chimera and racing off unharmed into the underhive.\n\nIt was at this point number 36 was finished in the rest room, only to come out to a darkened hallway filled with stunned gangers and arbites battling it out to the death. Taking out her shovel, 36 forced her way down the fastest route she could carve out, only to see us racing off to fight the Cabal without her. She would have been pissed had it not been for an aerial Arbite troop flyer taking off from the precinct\u2019s landing pad and going after our APC with extreme prejudice.\n\nMeanwhile in the luxurious halls of Lord Governor Gerontius Helmawr\u2019s palace, the governor was \u201cenjoying\u201d a pleasant night hosting a party for many of the boot lickers and kowtowed ambitious worms of his planet. The insufferable lot went about gossiping and indulging in the many delicacies that the governor had shipped from off world to hopefully delight his guest of honor. By his side, in a chair that was raised far higher than his own, sat one Inquisitor Bertha of the order Hereticus and her colorful entourage of interrogators. The assembled host of inquisitorial power did not entangle themselves with other nobles, nor actively inquired about the heretical threat that the Governor had called them all in on. The only thing the Emperor\u2019s holy agents would do, was sit quietly, watch everyone, while occasionally eating and drinking anything Lord Governor Helmawr would partake in first. There was very little that the governor could do to make his guests feel more accommodated under his roof, for the inquisitorial team that he had requested to his planet only cared for one thing and one thing only. He could see it in their Inquisitor\u2019s eyes, the sight of an Apex predator, actively seeking out what ever threats that hid within the flock of arrogant sheeple that made up his court. Whenever Gerontius attempted to start a conversation with the Inquisitor, her disinterested demeanor brought about a single word response that ended any hope of dialogue. It was not until midway through the festivity that the situation took a surprising turn, Inquisitor Bertha\u2019s vox comms lit up with news from another interrogator that had been sent to scout out the under belly of his hive city for clues that may lead to the eradication of the heretical weapons dealers.\n\n\u201cColonel Addas, report.\u201d Hearing from this Kriegsman of news regarding some gang killing other gangs did not seem noteworthy, but when some Junior Inquisitorial Acolytes joined the fray, mentioning how this gang might be of possible Xeno\u2019s origins and may have played a pivotal role in supplying the chaos tainted weapons, it immediately brought a sudden silence to everyone listening in. As the location of this \u201cCabal\u201d had been transmitted over, Inquisitor Bertha ended the vox call, stood up gracefully from her high chair, and planned to make her way out to deal with what could be considered without a doubt to be HERESY. Jumping in on the opportunity to earn the favor of his better, Lord Governor Gerontius Helmawr of Necromunda insisted to divert a full company of PDF troopers and place them all under the Inquisitor\u2019s direct command to help aid her in dealing with whatever heretical force was bringing ruin to his planet. For the first time since meeting the Inquisitor, the lord Governor was shocked utterly by the simplest of smiles from Inquisitor Bertha. It was a way of thanking the Lord Governor for doing his part in protecting the imperium, and how she would put the PDF company to good use in hunting all parties responsible for this most grievous of crimes. As Bertha and her entourage walked away, the Governor sat down and did something he had never done outside of the occasional political visit to the local shrines to the Emperor. He prayed, first and foremost for the protection of his soul and life, but he soon followed it up by begging the master of mankind to not let his family\u2019s seven millennia of loyalty to the Imperium, end with the Governor\u2019s ancestral planet turning into a flaming ball of exterminatus grade residue.\n\nBack within the refurbished interior of Rajah\u2019s APC, members of our group took the time to relax in the custom leather seats and safety features bedecked all around us. An important feature that helped comfort us all at the fact that our Chimera APC, with its experimental engine, was going at such a speed it would cuck the crap out of Speed racer and his Mach Five. Though the level of speed the APC was going at was soon limited with the flow of Hive traffic, which allowed some of us to take a deep sigh of relief as we safely buckled ourselves in. For the next few moments we tried to unwind from the whole entire Arbite station debacle and rest up before we had to go into a battle that might see all of us dead or at the mercy of some idiotically sinister Xenos. However those few moments of down time was ruined as Rajah, the dazed guardsman we decided to leave in charge of manning the APC\u2019s guns instead of driving, quickly informed us that an Arbite flyer was stalking us and was quickly shortening the distance.\n\nPopping his head out of the APC gunner hatch, Lord Daimen confirmed Rajah\u2019s statement, seeing a troop assault VTOL closing in on our position. Confused as to why one would be coming after us, Daimen used some of his psyker abilities to see what was going on inside the flyer. With a magical connection quickly made, the nobleman screamed out in disgust, severing his connection to the flyer and informing the rest of the group that the Arbite VTOL was hijacked by a group of ticked off chaos cultists who were currently seeking to bring about a blood bath through dark binary chants. Immediately Rajah attempted to aim the heavy weaponry of the Chimera and take the arbite flyer down. Unfortunately, the stunning effect of the lightbulb flash bangs and the distance between the flyer and the APC was too great of a negative modifier for any chance of successfully shooting down the enemies of Mankind. It seemed the only chance we would get at shooting it down was if the Flyer came at a close enough range to also acquired the same hit chance as us. So instead of waiting for the Hijacked flyer to unleash a barrage of anti-armored missiles or a daemonic horde down upon us, Daimen decided to take a crack at it.\n\nUsing the last of his technomancy for the next 24 hours, the noble psyker attempted to command the flyer to fail in reaching us. What Lord Daimen had hoped his command would do, involved the flyer to either stop entirely or be lowered to such a point that it would hover 3 inches off of the ground and then be subjected to the same horrible Hive traffic that we were limited by. What occurred would be beyond all of our expectations, to the point that it made us all see the potential of unleashing such unimaginably overpowered machine magic might within the Warhammer setting. With but a command the heretic controlled flyer suddenly made a sharp turn upwards, spinning in several high speed spiral rotations, before plummeting to the ground in what was said to be a nose dive of such perfect divine retribution ever witnessed by man. The ensuing crash resulted in an explosion so powerful that it not only killed all chaos worshipers inside, but also slayed over a hundred innocent civilians whose vehicles failed to properly stop before adding to the ever growing body count, not to mention injuring countless more and causing what will be known as the worst traffic accident in all of Necromunda\u2019s history. To top it all off, the explosions sent out such a disastrous shock wave that our APC, a good 2 miles away was effected by it, and to make matters worse no one in all of our group had the great wisdom to question the idea of letting Mok Glok, the feral worlder, to drive a highly complicated, military grade, armored personal carrier with six pedals and only one direction it was currently plummeting towards.\n\nI mean seriously most feral worlders had customs involving kidnapping woman from a settlement far away as the normal means of acquiring a spouse, and during a drought they would beg the Sun-Emperor that they worship to deliver rain by having the population do a whole lot of psychedelics that they found growing off of a dead human and then dance in order to appease the Master of Mankind instead of whipping themselves like the civilized portions of the Imperium did. Given that all of what I said is only a step or two bellow the standard idiocy that has raked the Imperium to its core, I will give Mok Glok some slack. By some means, his origins as a feral worlder did not kick in as he expertly drove through a hive cities worth of traffic while at the same time navigating his way to a base of what will be nightmarish Xeno manipulators. A very impressive track record, whose only hiccup that I and the rest of the group had was that Mok Glok drove us over the edge\u2026 specifically the edge of the hive level we were currently on. To put that into prospective, imagine driving off of a multiple story tall skyscraper, with nothing between the top point of the building and the ground floor to halt our fall. That was exactly what falling from one level of a city hive to another was like, all because Mok Glok failed to properly take control of the vehicle. \n\nSo as the Chimera APC plummeted to the lower level with at least a dozen other vehicles whose drivers also failed to overcome the shock wave, ours was \u201cmagically\u201d designed to miraculously survive even something of this level of outright lunacy. Seriously we all should have died from this, but by the Emperor not only did Lord Daimen and Rajah expertly made their way down to buckle themselves up safely, but each and every one of us inside the APC managed to come out of this thing completely unharmed\u2026.. with the exception of the APC. To say it was totaled would be an understatement, for our one and only fortress of mobile fortitude had been bent into unrecognizable shapes as it created a massive crater within the 158th floor of the Hive City. Upon impact, any free pointed shapes of the APC was bludgeoned into a dull square box, or fell off like the threads that allowed the whole entire thing to move.\n\nClimbing out of the wreckage, we all decided it would be best to remain quiet as Rajah, immediately and without question recovered from the after effects of the magically induced flash bang, and then erupted into such an emotional rage that it allowed a daemon of khorne to come into existence somewhere within the depths of the warp. Shouting at Mok Glok that his precious APC and possibly the only safe place in all of the 40k universe was totaled, maybe even beyond repair, left the feral worlder quiet and occasionally apologizing whenever he got the chance to speak up. Outright tired with all of this, the Weapons specialist thundered over his loss as he called into the local PDF\u2019s branch of the Mechanicus to come by and pick up his most precious treasure. From there we tried to decipher where exactly our APC had landed, we knew without a doubt it was not our target destination which required us to descend another level into the hive, but outside of that there was nothing else that gave us a clue as to where we were.\n\nDeciding that we needed to drop down another level as fast as possible, our Colonel Interrogator pulled out several Lathe Pattern Jump Packs out of Emperor knows where, and demanded all of us to immediately jump off the side of the hive ledge to get to the level down below as fast as possible. It took a moment before we all registered what exactly Interrogator Addas wanted from us, or even how he materialized those jump packs. Rajah whether out of blind anger or some extreme form of melancholy, was the first to act and decided to take up the mad Interrogators insane demand to get to the bottom level the fastest way possible. The rest of us saw this insanity for what it was and refused to follow it, instead of getting shot in the face by our interrogator, the smug bastard told us we will be left behind and that we should not expect him and his ideal acolyte to return to save us from whatever gang territory we got ourselves lost in. After that both Rajah and Interrogator Addas jumped off the ledge, with Rajah somehow expertly taking control of the jump pack and using it to make a somewhat graceful landing onto the lower level. The Interrogator on the other hand, failed to maneuver or even properly activate his jump pack as he rushed off the edge and joined the ever-growing suicide rate that ran rampant in most Hive cities.\n\nLord Daimen, lacking all skills to even operate a jump pack, decided to lead the rational remaining members of the group not towards any gang rampant territories but instead to a turbo lift with access to the level that the Cabal is rumored to be hiding on. After a short ride down the vandalized elevator, Daimen, Mok Glok, and 11 arrived within the area of Rajah and the interrogator\u2019s \u201clanding\u201d. Uniting the two groups, everyone stared at the fallen Colonel who was now fused to the pavement with a splash zone that went out in a nice 3-meter-long diameter. No one among us said a word at first, not even offering a prayer, once we all came to the conclusion that this was the best thing to happen to us since arriving in the 40k universe, Lord Daimen swiftly walked up to the late Colonel Addas and started rummaging through his pockets. After a good minute, the Nobleman of the Everbright family pulled out an Inquisitorial Rosette and one slightly cracked data pad that was cushioned by Interrogator Addas\u2019s great sacrifice. At first Lord Daimen offered the Rosette to any member of the group that wanted to take up the leadership role, when no one volunteered Daimen immediately went full Star Scream declaring himself the new leader and acting interrogator of the group.\n\nWithin the first few seconds of his rise to the coveted position of Inquisitorial Interrogator, Daimen let the ambition, the stupidity, and zealous desire to immediately solidify his new self-appointed rank go straight to his head. Informing the group that he would use his mighty psychic powers to pinpoint the exact location of the heretical weapons factory, thereby cutting off the Cabal from crafting anymore weaponry while Inquisitor Bertha besieged their base and slaughtered them. He claimed it was a decent plan since the Cabal would have most of their important members far away from any tainted chaos weaponry, and those that where crafting the weapons wouldn\u2019t get any reinforcement when Inquisitor Bertha made her move. Now the only issue with his plan was locating said weapon forge, and in that Lord Daimen Everbright failed utterly and spectacularly.\n\nIn the moments he attempted to esoterically sense out his enemies, believing it to be an easy thing to locate within an imperial world, he came to the sudden realization that all of the great trauma, misery, and downright horrid living of standards of a hive not only masked the taint of chaos, it also overwhelmed the noble psyker with what could only be said to be the most horrible thing he had ever undergone, which was then followed up with a vision of calamity to come. To the rest of the group it looked like Daimen had eaten something sour causing him to at first cringe and shake, but once he started bleeding out of his mouth, nose, eyes, and ears, all the while claiming that a massive Daemonic horde would attack the planet, it did more than just unsettle everyone. As the pysker dropped down to the ground babbling more horrible predictions of the future, the rest of the group just stood there, watching the High Born twitch before going as still as Colonel Interrogator Addas. He was perfectly fine just needed some rest, but the rest of the group discussed all that occurred with their first and now second interrogator before deciding on the right course of action.\n\nRajah after checking for a pulse on Daimen, decided the best and brightest option to ensure the groups survival was to strap a ring of explosives around the High Born psyker\u2019s neck. You know for his own protection, as well as that of the rest of the group. If a daemon invasion was coming and not some sort of delusion born from whatever aneurism that Nobleman Everbright suffered, the first person they would target would be without a doubt the psyker, so this was all just a nice bit of insurance against that. After expertly segmenting a series of minor demolition charges into a bomb collar, the weapons specialist then made a vox call to Inquisitor Bertha, who had just reached the Cabal base and was nearly done conquering it. With the upmost sincerity Rajah let her know of Interrogator Colonel Addas\u2019s tragic accident and how incredibly sorry he was to lose such a special man. What we got in the form of a response was not something anyone of us expected.\n\n\u201cDamn it, not again Addas, scrape him up and bring him to me. And never call me while I\u2019m busy.\u201d After hanging up and leaving us all stunned by her short statement that birth a thousand conspiracy theories ranging from a daemon host to some foul necromantic boga boga bullshit to explain what she meant by her one off comment. Doing as the inquisitor said, we scraped up the Colonel, and carried Daimen. Mid way through our trip to the Cabal base, we soon came to realize what Inquisitor Bertha meant by not again. In the 6 hours we spent lugging both Daimen and what remained of Interrogator Addas, none of us noticed the Colonel slowly knitting himself together and return to his perpetually insane healthy self. That was a clear shock to all of us who knew that no new perpetuals had existed since the 31st millennia\u2026 until now. Whoever\u2019s idea it was to make a Death Corps of Krieg Colonel into a perpetual was as mad as our revived Interrogator, who fell off of 11\u2019s shovel, landed on his feet, spread out his hands, and exclaim in jolly joy at his successful landing with the Jump Pack."], "2021-02-19": ["I need to get new magic armour and saw that elite tectonic is buyable on GE"], "2021-02-20": [""], "2021-02-21": ["# \ud83c\udd71undle - 2500c (about 40% off) \ud83e\udd75\n\n|Item|Price|\n|:-|:-|\n|*Goalkeeper* Crim Shibuya Breakout: (GE20)|100c|\n|Breakout: Vice (CC1)|100c|\n|Breakout: Watermelon|50c|\n|*Striker*/*Sweeper* Dominus: Pollo Caliente (GE20)|200c For Both|\n|Crim Octane: Buzzkill (GP20)|100c|\n|*Sniper* TW Octane: Chantico (GG19)|200c|\n|*Playmaker* Purple Octane: Griffon (GG18)|100c|\n|Orange/Pink/SB Octane: Metarudia|150c For All|\n|Orange/Lime Type S: Mobo (OG)|50c For Both|\n|*Sniper*/Uncert TW V17: Splashback (GG19/GL19)|200c For Both|\n|Snowstorm|100c|\n|Twisted Tree|100c|\n|2x Diestro: Rico (TAS)|50c For Both|\n|*Tactician* SB/*Scorer* Purple Merc: Athenas (GL19)|100c For Both|\n|*Striker* FG, Cobalt, Lime, BS, Pink, Purple Sujis ^(GP, GE, &amp; GP)|2000c For All|\n|*Turtle* TW Spiralis|200c|\n|Crim Truncheon|100c|\n|BS Maverick GXT|100c|\n|Cristiano|200c|\n\n* Total = 4200c (1700c off) \ud83d\ude33\n\n# Separately Selling \ud83d\udc40\n\n|Item|Price|\n|:-|:-|\n|Dissolver (PCC)|3200c \ud83d\ude31|\n|*Aviator* Dueling Dragons (cross-platform)|5000c \ud83d\udc09|\n|Saffron EQ (Trail)|1100c \ud83d\udd25|\n|Non-OG *GK* BS Clockworks|300c \ud83d\udc25|\n|Non-OG *GK* Grey Clockworks|200c  \u23f1|\n\n&gt;!Have a \ud83d\udc25 for looking!&lt;"], "2021-02-22": ["I'm thinking about buying a new microwave and I've heard that Costco can have great sales, and they sometimes add additional warranty time.

Many of us know the feeling of giving into this game a lot od our time And compete in skill groups to get ourselfs feeling of achieving something beyond our own skill. The game involves mindset, communication, reflexes And knowledge od there game. Valve has possibilities to make this game almost immortal in eyes off comunity if they Can find a way to get involved with their players and listen to them, their needs and wants.\n\nThe idea is that rather the pointless operations in which we actualy go away from the core of the game we could get something that could embrace the soul od CS GO and its competitive nature. If Valve can create actual working anti-cheat system that could find people cheat in this game even if they use support of third party partners like Faceit/ESEA and make it happen, then many players would be encouraged to try again in game matchmaking.\n\nNext step for greatness would be an implementation of statistics which Can get pretty detailed, into skill groups. But as we all know, skill is based on many factors and stats can help to get better a\u0165 the game because one can learn what is there to change in playstyle to get better. Which gives me idea that if Valve loves the game like so many players because of the game itself and not only because of the numbers its produce, then if they invest time and resources to give this game new breath of life in form of actualy rewarding players for playing game. They could introduce for highest rank in competitive game an elo/MMR ratings visble to players and leaderboard. In which they could compete for monthly prices maybe even for some form of items which rarity would be insane. So players on GE would get motivated to play matchmaking again, as well as introduce 128 tick servers for those players involved in leaderboard matchmaking. Games for leaderboard could be set to something like 2-3 games a day so 3rd parties like Faceit ESEA would not lose their players, but people would get rewarded for playng game. And as there are stars for which we can open skins they could give new colection of skins for each season which could be opend not only for money but as well for some form of points from matchmaking.\n\nIf you like this idea you can upvote it so it gets into the comunity and maybe at some point to Valve itself.

(skip to last paragraph for tl;dr)\n  \nSo I\u2019ve played RuneScape very casually off and on (moreso off) since MUDs started dying off in the early 2000s. While I only got back into it seriously since being furloughed during COVID I\u2019ve come to a realization... it\u2019s slowly become more of a GP grind with the intermittent quest in between. I\u2019ve also found that a lot of quests that would be difficult, or skills which would be difficult to train without the GE have become rather meaningless. Farming GP to buy d bones to bury for prayer or buying ess to craft runes (this one still does and always will suck regardless).\n  \nAnyhow, it got me thinking about how I\u2019d probably enjoy the game more as an Ironman account so I wouldn\u2019t be so focused on grinding out GP to just buy top gear. The untradables especially for skill pets I would have to work for just the same...\n  \nTl;dr Is there any content that becomes completely unplayable or unachievable as an Ironman account that is fun and enjoyable on a standard account? Any bosses or raids that I couldn\u2019t normally do? Any good reason NOT to play as an Ironman that a late earlygame/early midgame player may not consider?\nThanks!"], "2021-04-25": [""], "2021-04-26": [""], "2021-04-27": ["Any advices?"], "2021-04-28": ["Alright, I'm gonna list out a few things I would reccomend having before speedrunning said classes. Also, I would like to mention that because I  have only played the game for exactly 1 Month, and 1.5 Weeks, I have not progressed every class.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRequirements:  Transportation - Any class that isn't slow works, the best would probably be shinobi because of grapple. (really helps with going to yaalda with no climb) \n\nSilver - Silver can be easily farm with either of these 2 methods: Having an Ultra Blacksmith Alt or Server Hopping Crypt and Isle of Eth and the ravine at Sea of Dust. (Make sure to abuse mytril glitches )Server hopping nets about 80 silver per ore hop and 50-3000 per crypt hop. (3000 if you get lucky and find an artifact such as a pheonix down or ice essence).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrips/Rots - If you are a chaotic class, having a dinakeri can drastically cut the time getting grips, otherwise, just get a scroom alt and spam from orderly spawn. If you are going an orderly class, if u have access to teleporting to sky, do the quests there for extra silver and orderly but for the most part, just pay for jail service or get 2 scroom alts to get your silver and rots in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExp - This one is a very specific way  to speedrun and requires already having a necro, but just spam bounds in the dagger room at oresfall and keep the shreikers on docile. Knock the shriekers, respawn, rinse and repeat. The other way to speed run is to either just wait till ur day 1, mana punch for one round of z-scrooms and get your weapon exp for the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now that I'm done with the requirements here are the tips for each class! :\n\nDeep Knight - Deep Knight isn't necessarily the hardest, it is only difficult to find another CK to grip so just buy a CK Grip or if you have a Kasperan alt, make it a one skill church knight (Cost is about 650-700), get your grip and sell the rest for 1k. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbysswalker - The key to this one is not buying the regular greastsword, just get scroll of viribus and create a blockade for howler while doing both quests. Als when doing the torch quest (at least for me) there is 2 things that can happen. If you are doing the tortch quest and your tortch is not lit, you can cheese the distance you would have to go by just not moving and getting gated to giant's staircase then lighting your tortch with a nearby torch in Renova Town. Another tip is to record as you get the \"Come to me my child.\" Propt before jumping in, and here is why: [https://streamable.com/vpwgsx](https://streamable.com/vpwgsx) &lt; -- Abyss didn't glitch.  [https://streamable.com/qah30u](https://streamable.com/qah30u) &lt;-- Abyss glitched. Also, to be able to freely go in and out of the abyss, you only need 15 grips and to have done both quests. You only need the 60 grips for the skills.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDark Sigil Knight - Learn Deep Sunken. That's literally it. ( And do the dsk paper quest to actually go into the hall of mirrors.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragon Sage - Don't wear sigil helmet, get max climb, meditate, dragon speech and that's about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSigil Knight Commander - Nothing really here, just get your orderly from rots and you should be able to afford it. (Get Solan's asap, without it you are essentially a Sigil Knight with extra steps.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhisperer - Just get your silver and get the Wraith. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOni - Make sure ALL and I mean ALL of your prerequisuites are done, if they aren't don't even think about talking to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, for anyone that is interested in what I have progressed over my 1 Month and 1.5 Weeks playing Rogue Lineage:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbyssdancer(2x): Once as a 1 skill Kasperan and the second time and a Max Uber Godstruck\n\nDeep Knight (7x): My first time getting deep knight was on my 1st Dinakeri Alt and I got Deep Knight 7 times on it.\n\nAbysswalker (5x): Abysswalker was my first gaiadwelling build (Made an Elder Vamp Kasperan) the other 4 were from Kasperan 3 other times and Dinakeri once.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChuch Knight (23x): My first week playing I got Church Knight on my first race ever, Gaian. I would literally wipe everyday when I progressed Church Knight because of my house members either goofing around or purposely killing me. (was very toxic, and my first week of playing I progressed CK 8 times in one week due to said house members and exploiters constantly gripping me and me not knowing about the rogue lineage discord till my second week of playing.

Every now and again, though, I do a 5-stack MM, just to play something a bit different and keep my rank active.\n\nRecently, every single game I\u2019ve played has been a crushing defeat, most recently playing with an LEM, LE, MG2, SEM and myself at MG1. End of the game and everyone we\u2019re playing against is MG2, but all of their profiles have previously been up to LEM/SMFC. Even then, they\u2019re getting KDs of 2-3, whereas only one guy on our team manages to get a KD of 1 and the rest of us are 5 in 15.\n\nI\u2019ve seen more and more of this recently - loads of profiles now sitting in GN/MG that used to be high black ranks. As well as this, their match histories show that they played all the way up to high ranks, then have a gap of a few months to a year and then come back at a much lower rank. \n\nI have to assume that these are stacks of smurfs who have multiple accounts; they play on one account, ranking up until they can no longer get easy wins, then switch to another account that\u2019s since ranked down to a level they can decimate at. Obviously I hate tryhard smurfs with a passion, but I don\u2019t understand why the ranking systems allows this to happen.\n\nIf someone at a high rank takes a break from CS and then comes back to the game, they should keep the rank they were at. If it means that they\u2019re no longer playing as well as they used to, then let them derank at that point, rather than trying to preemptively guess how much their performance will degrade over time. \n\nI would think that it\u2019s better to have someone who comes back at GE, plays at a LE skill level and deranks, than someone at an LE skill level playing in GN because Valve assumes they\u2019ll have deskilled while away from the game. It\u2019s easier to make up for one team member\u2019s poor performance than try and take on one player who massively outranks you. \n\nThe only reason I can really see for the current deranking system is that Valve want a normal distribution to ranks, with most people around upper GN, and don\u2019t want people levelling up accounts to GE and then leaving them there, bloating that rank\u2019s numbers, but is this really worth wrecking MM for a large chunk of the player base?  \n\nRemove rank decay, make it so rank changes take less time to happen, and this kind of smurfing problem would be way less prominent.

And now I\u2019m both [half] convinced and [fully] exhausted after the realization that Cabbage Guy went from being one of the silliest side characters to one of the most powerful benders, and definitely one of the most badass characters in the ATLA universe. \n\nLet\u2019s assume Lao Ge is still alive when Aang is... Obviously, it\u2019s a stretch. That said, I am 100% convinced that should he be alive, he is NOT Guru Pathik. Guru Pathik uses the flowing stream/river analogy to help Aang open up his chakras. His analogy is also subliminally a description of how he has managed his longevity (he\u2019s like what? 150yrs old?). \n\nHowever Lao Ge states: \u201cTHOSE WHO GROW, LIVE AND DIE. THE STAGNANT POOL IS IMMORTAL, WHILE THE CLEAR FLOWING RIVER DIES AN UNCOUNTABLE NUMBER OF DEATHS.\u201d \n\nThis would mean that within the confines of duality, Lao Ge is the yin to Pathik\u2019s yang. Pathik is the flowing river, where as Lao Ge is the stagnant pool. Call it \u2018fleshbending\u2019 if you will, but the dude found out how to use earthbending to sense the vibrations of his own anatomy at an atomic or subatomic level, and has managed to figure out how to manipulate them to stay finely tuned in one specific form\u2014aka the stagnant pool. He obviously then helps Kyoshi do the same. \n\nAnd the fact it is pointed out that he is randomly feeding cabbages seemingly outta nowhere to Pengpeng is suspect. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard the expression \u201cpeel back the layers of a cabbage/onion\u201d as a metaphor for the human experience? You can peel layer after layer of a cabbage and it still maintains its shape and form. It stays finely compressed. \n\nIf you cut it down the middle, you\u2019ll see all those many layers crammed together to make the whole. The pattern inside resembles a flower of life, so to speak. The cabbage is simply another form of symbolism behind the stagnant pool. And Lao Ge has every single layer held together,  compressed, exactly as he needs them to be, forming his immortal existence. \n\nThis also is a good explanation as to why the Cabbage Merchant seems to always be exactly where Team Avatar are going, usually before they arrive too. It also explains how even though it\u2019s noted he is not allowed to have his cart inside Omashu nor Ba Sing Se\u2014he manages to get it inside both cities. And replace it, and the cabbages, every time it wrecks. \n\nMaybe he grew tired of being the assassin, and after Kyoshi learned a lot of his tricks of the trade, and her just generally being the baaaad mamma jamma she was, he felt content taking a different path in his looooong life. He trusted her and her future lives to keep the chaotic good type of order he eternally seeked and manifested. So maybe he was always there checking in on his investment in the avatar.
