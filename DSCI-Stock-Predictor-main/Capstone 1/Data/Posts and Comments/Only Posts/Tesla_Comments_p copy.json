A 1 - 2% gain is a solid base hit for me, but I've let positions ride for 15%+ moves (1/2 out then trailing stop). With 4x margin I'm often trading positions well into six figures, so a base hit can be several thousand in profit. Sometimes I get shaken out, but most my strategies are breakout or bailout, so I avoid taking big haircuts. My P&amp;L is a steady uptrend with some months choppier than others. \n\nNow, with the flood of new traders and hype around small caps this year (granted we had some wild moves, esp this summer), I'm seeing even seasoned traders shift towards small caps and I'm starting to feel like a conservative trader. \n\nI honestly don't understand the appeal. If you're a serious trader and you're in this for the long haul, I don't know how you can look at 30, 50, 80% moves within minutes and see that as a viable stock to trade. Even if you're in the small club who can pull it off, who wants that kind of stress? I can think of a couple well known traders who have been in the small cap game for years (who may or may not make more money selling courses than trading), and even with years of experience, you can tell how stressed out they get trading. Yes, all trading has stress, but holding a position in a halt going down isn't exactly the same as stopping out for a 0.5% loss. \n\nOne argument I often hear is that high volatility small caps are good for growing small accounts. I'd argue the opposite. If you have a $30k account on 4x margin and you capture on average 0.5% gain every day, you're making \\~$150K before tax. If you think you're above that as a new trader, you're probably going to learn humility the hard way. On the other hand, if you have a $30K account and you traded a name like STAF today, you could've easily lost 10-20% within seconds - enough to put you below PDT requirements. \n\nI'm not trying to bash small cap traders, and if it works for you, more power to you. I am constantly learning and growing as a trader and I want to understand the appeal from people who have been in the game a long time.

An extreme example, if Elon musk holds 50% of tesla, and the TSLA is currently trading 1000 per share, at the news that Elon is looking to sell stock, the price of each share could quickly drop to 300 per share.  \n\nif they value by holding non-public companies, you simply cannot sell it without a perspective buyer, and you can't withdraw 5% of the company's value in cash, because that would destroy the cash flow and put it into bankruptcy territory. \n\nA billionaire with a net worth of 1 billionaire would be lucky if he can get 10 million through the liquidation of his assets, especially when everyone has to sell to pay for a wealth tax.

I\u2019m sorry I did it. If you want an explanation, here it is: I was expelled from medical school for an ethics violation during research. This made me just an asshole with a BS in Biology from a state college with a lot of debt, which incidentally can be canceled upon my death.\n\nWe weren\u2019t as close as I wanted us to be, and near the end I wasn\u2019t really sure if you wanted to. But I loved you as a brother and as much as I find your personality a bit too edgy and grating sometimes, I am incredibly proud of you.\n\nMy only regret is leaving mom out alone in the world. She\u2019s incredibly vulnerable, fragile, and insecure at this point in life, so please contact her and visit her as much as possible. She will need this especially at this point in time, more than ever. Please be empathetic. That\u2019s my only wish from me. I\u2019m not going to be upset if you don\u2019t come to my funeral \u2013 I didn\u2019t want one anyway \u2013 but I really hope you still show up in \\[STATE\\] just for her. Also put it in your google calendar annually: mom\u2019s birth is \\[DATE\\].\n\nAnother note to add. Mom may misunderstand you and she may be annoying, but she never lies. She will never be untrustworthy. Go to her with your problems, she might be judgmental but at least she will be genuine about caring for you, more than anyone else in the world. Anything you interpret as a lie from her \u2013 such as me not in school \u2013 is a misinterpretation that I didn\u2019t bother correct. She\u2019s more right than you assume.\n\nI\u2019m so apologetic for making her your responsibility. At some point you may have to talk to her about her finances directly. While mom has a 401k, I would prefer her not to use it except for a last resort. I\u2019m also afraid she will mismanage that money in the stock market, even if she has the rights to do whatever she wants with it. While mom can work a job, the reality is she cannot work for long. Her health is terrible: I\u2019m a medical student, but I am reasonably confident in my diagnosis of her for fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis in the knees, stress incontinence, disc slips, and severe depression. The more she works, the bigger her medical bills. Take it from me: if you want to deal with mom less, give her enough so she can live comfortably without working. And I haven\u2019t even discussed how difficult it is for mom to get a job: her mugshot, despite charges being dismissed, is still online illegally and has severely affected her employment opportunities.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much this experience will change her, but mom has always been hesitant asking for a lot of money: she\u2019s willing to use your credit card for some basic necessities, but I think she would need at least $1000/month to get by comfortably. Ideally, she\u2019d get $2000/month (I intended to give mom more, but she told me she wished me and you to give her each $1000/month; she expected only me to provide for her). She sacrificed everything and lives vicariously through us, and while I understand you have your differences, she deserves something for her investment. If she does decide to go back to \\[HOMELAND\\] (where job opportunities will be even less for her), her social security will be cut and our relatives will continuously badger you for money. Only give the money to mom.\n\nSince we drifted apart, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re complaining or frustrated about being mom\u2019s default caretaker. But if you are, I understand. Mom does too. I know she owns significant amount of assets (401k, the house), but there\u2019s more to it than that. The backyard needs renovation. The house is falling apart: ceiling leaks, broken appliances, a leaky faucet. She still has a $94k mortgage. Her health is abysmal and she\u2019s on and off on Medicaid (better than nothing, but shitty coverage is still shitty: she cannot afford routine gynecological checkups and her stress incontinence makes her prone to UTIs, which will potentially lead to kidney damage). When she qualifies for Medicare, it\u2019s not going to be much of an improvement. Social security isn\u2019t enough \u2013 she won\u2019t get much anyway, being that she\u2019s been out of the workforce and can only claim half of dad\u2019s benefits.\n\nI think she shouldn\u2019t sell the house until for a couple more years to get the most out of the investment; even then, she may have to sell it anyway due to rising property taxes. Our state recently repealed the \\[AMENDMENT\\], which I think will be troubling for mom to keep the property within the next decade. If she does sell it, she has to pay a 20% capital gains tax on the house (as opposed to you inheriting it upon her death, in which case you pay none of that). Let her use the 401k when she has no other choice \u2013 you pass away / go to school, house repair / management, medical bills \u2013 at least until she turns 67/68, the standard social security retirement age (unfortunately it will only rise as the years go on). If I\u2019m doing the math correctly, I think she\u2019d be able to live on her own by then if she stays healthy (not likely, but you can make sure that she lives comfortably). I wish I could convince you to give her a lifetime supply of $1000/month, but you\u2019ve always distanced yourself away from family obligations, which is why I\u2019m asking for the bare minimum of $500/month until she gets social security. Monetary support for about a decade, money that she\u2019s too afraid to ask from you because she prefers your company and love over her own basic needs. You ought to discuss this with her. In the end, when she dies, everything will go down to you anyway.\n\nI wish we were closer. There are so many more things I wish we talked about, such as art and life.

Through your connections go into politics or business instead.

By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. \n\n**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.\n\n**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)\n\n**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.\n\n**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.\n\nThis is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:\n\n[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)\n\n**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity.

Hundreds of thousands of retail investors are buying the $GME 60C ($60 $GME call options) across the options calendar and Market Makers can't hedge properly, because there are not enough $GME shares to buy. (Basically, there are were more short positions than shares available)\n\n1a. What is a **Market Maker**? A market maker is an individual or brokerage firm that buys and sells securities for its own account, at prices it displays in an exchange's trading system, with the primary goal of profiting on the **bid-ask spread**. The most common type of market maker is a brokerage house that provides purchase and sale solutions for investors in an effort to keep financial markets liquid.\n\n2. As stock prices increase, the shorts are forced to cover their shares borrowed, by the Market Makers (who they've borrowed them from). But because of the huge supply/demand imbalance, these shorts have to cover at prices that seem irrational, but are rational based on the supply/demand equilibrium of available shares. What's going on, is probably an infinity squeeze, which is the result of heavy over-shorting of shares, which are now difficult or impossible to cover. (Basically, **There are too few $GME shares available, and shorts will be forced to buy back $GME at any price).** This triggers a mass panic for the exits by anyone who are short shares.\n\n2a. What is a **Short Squeeze**? A short squeeze is when a stock\u2019s price jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to prevent an even greater losses. Them buying up the stock, adds to the upward pressure on the stock's price. (Basically, a short squeeze accelerates a stock's price rise as short-sellers bail out, to cut their losses. Short sellers are being squeezed out of their positions, usually at a loss.)\n\nIn financial history, the two widely cited cases of an infinite short squeeze are the Volkswagen infinite squeeze of 2008 and the Blue Apron one of 2020.\n\na. Prior to October 2008, Porsche controlled 30% of VWs shares. The government fund of Lower Saxony (home province of VW in Germany) owned an additional 20% of VW as a strategic stake. In addition, various index funds owned around 5% of VW (These index funds were required to hold VW in proportion to its 17% weight in the DAX, such that they would not be able to sell simply due to changes in the price of VW).\n\nb. So, you can do the math, 55% of VW shares were already unavailable in the market. As a result, when Porsche increased its stake by an additional 44%, it meant that the true available float went down from 45% of outstanding shares to around just 1% of outstanding shares. Suddenly the seemingly \u201clow\u201d short interest of 12.8% turned in to a massive supply and demand imbalance.

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/\"boomer\" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits.

Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.\n* Take the \"Calls\" as very discounted, and \"Potentially A Call\" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow.

Some don't have spotgamma data, but all have tradingvolatility data. This data is a bit stale - it's Wednesday AM data, so whatever happened today changed it in terms of option open interest.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz](https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz)\n\n**How to interpret:**\n\nWhenever there is call or put open interest, it COULD BE options dealers are net sellers. Whatever the net 'short gamma' (total net options sold) by dealers will in turn result in gamma hedging as the price of the stock moves past. This generally means that dealers buy if the price going up, and sell if price going down, regardless of if they have short puts or short calls on the books. This effect can be as much as 80% of the total options outstanding in my experience, but is usually less. This caused a lot of the GameStop action we saw before known as a gamma squeeze.  It is possible to create the reverse, and that's a hobby of Steve \"Stevie\" Cohen (to sell a giant straddle and lock the price down). If a stock seems to be de-volatilized after I said it had a lot of gamma, there's some chance this happened. \n\nDelta de-hedging is also a thing. When options expire, speculators (read: you) tend to sell the itm options for profit, and tend not to roll them fully, which causes reversion against the options. In other words, if there are a lot of ITM puts expiring, the stock will tend to go up, while if there are a lot of ITM calls expiring, the stock will tend to go down. This tends to matter the most on the monthly and quarterly and yearly option expirations. This Friday appears to not be one of those.\n\nBecause this data is stale, you can't draw firm conclusions, and you'd want the update tomorrow if you have access to these tools (spotgamma and tradingvolatility, or you can add by hand). However, it's important to understand the magnitude of these gamma hedging effects by dealers. These are always relative to the floating shares of the stock. For reference:\n\nAMC: 114m shares (Maybe, they just had a bunch of new issuances and debt conversion, could be higher)\n\nCRSR: 88.1m shares\n\nSNDL:435m shares\n\nAPHA:312m shares\n\nTLRY: 137m shares\n\nGME: 70m shares\n\nIn my experience, if a price move will involve 20% or more of the shares in open interest (options contracts x 100), it will tend to cause gamma squeeze effects in a lot of speculation. Numbers under this will still impact. It starts being not very noticeable at 5% or less for a price range (such as a 20% spread). Typically the price ranges you would look to would be plausible price ranges.\n\nToday, a lot of weed stocks ran all the way up their gamma ramps and stalled, which means new gamma ramps need to be constructed, and I would expect it to be harder to move these weed stocks up more tomorrow except for SNDL (more on that below) For this reason, you will need to look CLOSELY at the new options printed for end of week and on as of tomorrow AM (or Thursday) when option data comes out. Right now, these stocks will look like all downside - gamma ramp below current position, since those stocks ripped through their gamma ramps completely today.\n\n**Brief analysis:**\n\nGME: I honestly have no idea. The stock is for sure gamma dominated right now, and getting past this expiry will reduce volatility a lot as things roll off the book. Interesting, there are a LOT of puts and most of the purchases of options appear to be puts right now.\n\n**TLRY**: This just ripped through a gamma ramp, forcing buy of a remaining 5 or so million shares on the float of 137, which is a small effect. Most of the buying today was thus new capital coming in, which is quite remarkable. Looking at the OI tomorrow for expiry friday will be very important in understanding what is going on, but, **THIS STOCK WAS FUELED BY PURE NEW BUYING AND NEW CALL OPTION PURCHASE.** I guess there's no substitute for being \"The\" weed stock. Just remember that every dollar up requires the same amount of new capital as the last dollar - 50% days get a lot harder when already up 50% the day before. New gamma ramps will be created, but these get harder as IV has already risen a lot. Thus, would expect the momentum to continue, but this will quickly go into a bubble state like GME did. Be cautious!\n\n**APHA**: This also just fully ripped through gamma ramp, and in fact did on Tuesday. At this point, it's all dependent on new open interest creation and money. Gamma ramp wasn't actually that big though, and the forced selling friday is small. This appears to mostly just be straight buying. \n\n**SNDL**: I don't have data on spotgamma, so I had to rely on just tradingvolatility.com. My read is that this stock has an outrageous amount of gamma, on the order of the float of the stock, and you can expect more vol. This leads me to suspect that the float data isn\u2019t accurate (outstanding shares are 1.5b while float is stated to be 436m). There are some moderate ITM call expirations Friday, on the order of 15-20m shares on a float of 435m shares, so I don\u2019t expect a huge impact.  But, this stock appears to be pretty spring-loaded with options and could go nuts again.  Examining data tomorrow will be important.\n\n**CRSR**: This isn\u2019t actually that gamma dominated at a float of 88m. It\u2019s right in the middle of a big gamma ramp, so buying will send it up fast \u2013 and selling will send it down fast. Friday expirations are not that significant. This stock will behave semi-normally as a result. \n\n**AMC**: I\u2019m not sure what the float is here, but the actual option OI suggests AMC is in the middle of a gamma ramp, and that gamma ramp is immensely strong relative to float \u2013 this stock is expected to continue a lot of volatility unless these options are a bunch of covered calls or covered puts. My suspicion from price action is that they are not, and this will keep being very volatile. This ramp will lose strength in the 8s, so it will require a much heavier lift to get past there. Friday expirations are immaterial. Selling also can send it down, much like CRSR. \n\n*My positions: I own none of these!  But I'm long the market, and you guys dumping your winners to buy TLRY and similar is I think why NDX took a dump this morning, and that kind of hurt.

I do not recommend any position here. Everything here is speculation and my personal opinion and not to be construed as factual in any way. I may not be correct on some of my numbers. Do your own research before making a play.*** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditional disclaimer: I am not in any way suggesting that people sell at a certain price en masse. We are all individual investors and choose to hold or sell based on our own tolerances and decision making. This is merely discussing selling *strategy,* not a call to action. For that reason, I will not be sharing my specific sell prices although I will be sharing what got me there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the past two days, I've been developing an exit strategy that works very well for me. Keep in mind that I have over 100 shares, so the things I am considering might not apply to someone who is holding less. Still, there are a few areas of strategy that I want to share and hopefully can stimulate some good discussion. Here are a few key points that I thought of for myself, feel free to discuss and disagree with if you wish:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) **Determine a price point to begin your selling.** Whatever reason you have to select a price point is up to you, but for many of us this is life-changing money and we should all be asking ourselves the question *what do we want to get out of this?* You may have to revisit this point at times as you consider your risk/reward tolerance and how bad you need the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) **Set aside a certain percentage of your holdings to DCA some profit.** For some it might make sense to hold to 10k but for many of us, locking in profits incrementally would be financially beneficial and frees up some money to buy dips in other securities, exercise options,  or to simply withdraw if you need the cash. I know it is fun to say \"10k isn't a meme\" but we have to be realistic about our financial goals with this trade and plan accordingly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) **Consider exercising options with your profits/cash.** If you have been paying attention to my positions I added in my previous posts, you'll know that I am playing some FD monster spreads and some high(ish)-value naked calls. The reason I invested in those naked calls is so I would have the ability to exercise them if the situation makes sense for me. To me, having flexibility is important and I want to be in a position to react at whatever the market throws at me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, side note- I have been doing research on how long it takes for exercised options to hit your account, and I couldn't find any information on it. Can somebody please educate me in the comments?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) **How do we determine the increments in which we sell?** I've considered three ways to do this:\n\na- Percentage increments\n\nb- Dollar increments\n\nc- Sell increments by the day\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo me, percentage increments is more attractive and I feel gives me a nice ladder of profit that I am comfortable earning from my position. Think about what might be right for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) **Most importantly, HAVE A PLAN!** Whether your plan is to hold until $69,420 or sell it all Tuesday at open, make a plan and STICK TO IT! Everyone has different financial situations and motivations in this trade. No matter the context, you must have a plan and *stick to it!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) **No matter when or where you trade, have a plan for your freshly minted tendies.** Reinvest or pull out? SPY puts or buying the TSLA dip? Buying GME calls? Whatever the case may be, have a plan of action for your money. For many of us, this is more money than we have ever had to manage. I will personally be taking out a large chunk to make other investments, and keeping a chunk in to continue to play the market as the chaos ensues. Either way, the theme of this post remains the same: **have a plan.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7) **Don't be an emotional trader.** As price moons, dopamine will moon as well and we need to learn how to manage ourselves in those moments. Having a plan and sticking to it is a great way to do that. I will personally be setting aside a portion of my position to sell at my emotional discretion, but I am not doing that with more than I am comfortable with losing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are all the main things I thought of, and things that are important for me to consider with my style of investing.

Personal price target and play at the bottom.\n\n**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE AND HAS BEEN WRITTEN FOR INFORMATIVE PURPOSES - POSITIONS LISTED BELOW.**\n\nStock is Piedmont Lithium, ticker PLL which is dual listed on the NASDAQ (last US$53.74) and ASX (last AU$0.73).\n\n**Background**: Piedmont lithium is a exploratory (close to production) miner of lithium, with it's primary operations based right outside Charlotte NC. Their current trajectory is to start mining spodumene contrctrate by the middle of this year and become the worlds cheapest, per tonne, producer of lithium hydroxide. The company is in it's final stages of obtaining all the necessary permits for mining and chemical processing out of NC and the basic idea is that because they will be able to mine and produce the end product within a close proximity they will be able to outperform other South American miners (that produce lithium from brine which needs to be shipped to China to get the final product). Company is relatively small cap at $767M and but liquidity is decent at 1.1M average volume. \n\n[https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/908664/piedmont-lithium-secures-landmark-section-404-permit-to-advance-its-north-carolina-lithium-project-908664.html](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/908664/piedmont-lithium-secures-landmark-section-404-permit-to-advance-its-north-carolina-lithium-project-908664.html)\n\n**Notable news:**\n\n* Supply deal with Tesla: [https://stockhead.com.au/resources/tesla-supplier-piedmont-lithium-expects-more-deals-with-carmakers/](https://stockhead.com.au/resources/tesla-supplier-piedmont-lithium-expects-more-deals-with-carmakers/)\n\nThis one is pretty old news, from Oct-20, so the intial hype is priced in. But I think it's important to highlight espeacially for those of you who want exposure to TSLA without going balls deep.\n\n* Expanding supply with deal with Sayona Mining: [https://stockhead.com.au/resources/piedmont-lithium-and-sayona-mining-deal-highlights-importance-of-local-projects-to-us-ev-makers/](https://stockhead.com.au/resources/piedmont-lithium-and-sayona-mining-deal-highlights-importance-of-local-projects-to-us-ev-makers/)\n\nShortening of supply chains and securing reliable sources of lithium is extremly important in the long run. As the current biggest controller of end product lithium is China (as most of the worlds mined lithium needs to be sent there for processing).\n\nA reliance on China in the long run is not great due to obvious reasons, and also the costs associated of shipping the stuff often makes even the cheapest lithium mines very expensive.\n\n**Financials**\n\nAs I mentioned, PLL is still in it's final exploration stage and obtaining permits for it's operations.\n\nOver the last quarter Dec-20 their cash burn from operating and investing activities was $4.1M (or $8.6M 6 months to date).\n\nThe also recently raised additional equity during the period which left their total Cash and equivalents at $70M at the end of the period.\n\nLooking a bit further into their annual report for 2020, they made a loss of $6.1M for 2020, down from -$10.1M in 2019 (due to the exploratory nature).\n\nOn the balance sheet their Net assets sat at $24M (pre-equity raising) with little to no liabilities.\n\nOverall a strong balance sheet and P&amp;L that can sustain the current rate of cash burn for sometime in the negative event of mining delays and other hiccups.\n\nI recommend taking a dive into the financials yourself.\n\n**Global lithium demand/supply**\n\nSo outside of the fact that PLL is positioning iteself to be a scalable, low cost, local producer of lithium hydroxide the elephant in the room is, does the world need more lithium?\n\nAnd is demand and supply moving in such a way that pricing works in the our favour?\n\nThe cost of lithium has steadily declined over the past years partly due to the economies of scale that producers achieve as they ramp up production but also cost efficiencies achieved from advances in extraction and processing techniques.\n\nI believe we are at at a turning point, or at least a price stablisation equilibrium as the demand for lithium increases due to the expanding domestic and commercial use for it. [https://www.australianmining.com.au/news/lithium-prices-move-out-of-gloom/](https://www.australianmining.com.au/news/lithium-prices-move-out-of-gloom/)\n\nI think the reality of our slowly decarbonising future is that we need storage solutions for electricity for when the sun don't shine and wind doesn't blow. The current technologies that are showing any decent scalability is Lithium batteries and Hydrogen. Lithium is far more advanced in terms of development and it is my view, and Papa Elon's that lithium will be here to stay as a core resource that will enable us to move into a wider EV market, power storage and decarbonised world.\n\n**The play**\n\nPersonally I am in on PLL for over 10,000 shares (@AU$0.45), my play is mid to long term as a look towards the commencement of commercial operations this year as well as seeing how the global appetite will move as EV's start to overtake internal combustion.\n\nAs much as I like TSLA, its too expensive for my taste and something like buying into the supply chain for the exposure to any upside in TSLA seems very reasonable to me.\n\nPrice target: AU$1 (US$70-80) EOY.\n\nCurrent entry price: AU$0.7 (or lower) or US$50 or lower."], "2021-02-17": [" **What is EHang Technologies:**\n\nEHang (Nasdaq: EH) is the world's leading autonomous aerial vehicle technology platform company.

Suspicious Timing  \n\n   1. As the Chinese New Year is in full swing, it is a week long federal holiday. This ensure that panic sellers will not be able to reach with out any additional information.\n   2. Slow releases starting around 1200EST-1400EST or roughly 2300-0300 in China, which also ensures that any response will be delayed until after panic selling has been complete.\n   3. This in fact caused the stock price to drop almost 62% which brings to price back to roughly \\~1 month ago before its run up.\n2. Lack of Personnel in EHang Locations, Video Released by Wolfpack Research:  \n\n   1. No metadata on Youtube video, unable to verify date and time stamp. Claimed to be shot during January *but no exact dates are provided.*\n   2. Video taken over the federal holiday, there of course would be no people in the building.\n   3. But what we are able to see is that there are actual EH216 vehicles that are being built and/or assembled, with lots of parts in boxes. If there were actual fraud, there would be absolutely no reason to even spent the effort in having all those parts and pieces. In fact there would be ample security to ensure that no one would ever discover the deception.\n3. eVTOL expert Dr. Moore from Uber and NASA  \n\n   1. Regarding his opinion of the use of hobby motors and general quality. Working at NASA we have seen how stagnant NASA has become due to their over redundancy and unwillingness to take risk compared to how SpaceX operates. But redundancy is waste, especially in startups that do not have the federal money. If \"hobby\" motors work, then why over-engineer something? I think we can draw parallels to early Tesla motors but the key thing is that they worked and that is all that matters.\n   2. Lack of research budget, when you work for NASA anything that is not in the billions would of course be considered anemic, but the company is working first to pioneer passenger VTOLs and then moving on getting acceptance for autonomous technology.\n4. Flight Autonomy Dream (Headline: It is not, its already here and it works)  \n\n   1. Flight autonomy is already well used in the the aviation industry. In fact the majority of your domestic and international flights utilize autopilot where the pilot has pre-entered in a specific heading and altitude.\n   2. DJI with their Mavic Air series are able to perform limited autonomous flight in a consumer drone for under $1000 including takeoff, object detection and avoidance, GPS flight routine, landing, and return to base landing. If a consumer drone maker can do this it is not a leap of imagination to think that the same principles can be applied here.\n   3. ***There is nothing special regarding autonomous flight.***\n   4. In fact you can see from this Wikipedia image regarding autonomous control levels shows that as early as in 2000s with the Predator and Global Hawk autonomous flight was already widely used in the defense sector. Today the focus into the future are fully autonomous swarms, far far ahead of what is necessary for autonomous drone flight.\n\nAutonomous Control Level Trend\n\n1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Office Visit - Distributor of EHang  \n\n   1. Interview with employee who \"claimed\" to be the finance manager pushing to sell their own drones, which does not make sense because Kunxiang does not make any drones and is a distributor. Also the finance manager reportedly said that their drone had *4 hours flight time* which is an absolutely unbelievable claim versus EHang's 30 minutes of total flight time which is far more realistic. No additional evidence was provided by WolfPack regarding the \"claimed\" finance manager, name, title or any of substance.\n\nOf the portions that provide a negative attack and are at best circumstantial evidence\n\n1. \\# of NewsWire PR Articles - Apparently having 55 news article in 14 months constitutes a pump and dump scheme.\n2. Lack of Infrastructure Progress and Investments - Because not all progress has gone according to plan, I wonder what other large companies have had the same issues that have become one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n3. Misleading English/Chinese Press Release  \n\n   1. While the titles maybe misleading, Googling the original Chinese press releases identifies does not actually mislead any of the readers. It does not make any false claims regarding passenger vehicles or their permitting, in fact it is actually Dr. Mark Moore who is making the *assumptions based upon the title*. And you know what they say about assumptions, they make an a\\*\\* out of you and me. I would think that a NASA engineer would take his time reading the article, I mean they certainly are taking their time with SLS.\n\nOf the portions that have merit:\n\n1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Price Disparity  \n\n   1. Of all the points in the short research, this maybe one of merit.\n   2. The buyer purchased EH216 at widely varying prices from 1.5 million RMB per unit to 150 million RMB as stated in two difference SEC Sales Contract reports. This wide disparity is a note for cause.\n2. Rapidly Growing Accounts with low account receivable and allegation of fabricated sales  \n\n   1. Is this not similar to how TSLA presold cars? Additional research needs to be done into this.\n   2. Again the research does not say it is evidence of fabricated sales but only that is a textbook indication. ***Again circumstantial evidence is not real evidence.***\n   3. ***Why is this buried at the tail end of the report? At page 19 out of 33.*** If this was truly damning than it should have been at the forefront.\n3. Ongoing Lawsuit  \n\n   1. Could be a future issue, however without knowing the full evidence of the trial it is difficult to make judgement.\n\nWolfPack Research History so far (two words, desperate &amp; terrible)\n\n[https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports](https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports)\n\nOf the 6 short researches, all of them insisted that the various companies committed fraud and yet ***5 out of the 6 stocks*** are up since their report. I will not mention the tickers as they have all been banned by the mods. With a singular exception, they say a broken clock is wrong twice a day. If ever there was a clear evidence of false reporting and market manipulation this is it. In my opinion WolfPack research utilizes its financial disclaimer purporting that this research is only an expression of their opinion to side step any legal ramifications.\n\nI have to state that $EH has been on a tear lately and as a very young startup it has been on a tremendous run up.

They're giving away a PS69 and some kick ass gear. The music intensifies. Some dude swallows a flaming sword for some reason. No one told him to.\n\nThat's all I see. The vision doesn't go any further. But it's enough to convince me. \n\nMy ape friends keep asking me, \"When do I finally sell? What's the exit strategy? What happens if it dips?\"\n\nMy brothers in apehood, I will tell you exactly what I tell them: \"I am not a financial advisor. I hold positions in GME and AMC.\"\n\nThen I reassure them not to think of today, tomorrow, or next year. Don't think about what the stock is doing, how badly the regulatory agencies will likely neglect the retail trader, or the extent to which the big boys get off the hook (for now).\n\nThese things will not last. We know this. It's as sure as prophecy itself. The meek shall inherit the earth. And that meek is a small, little known collection of retards, apes, gamblers, and bank robbers.\n\nSo when you're thinking about selling GME, ask yourself what better entity is there to patronize for time immemorial?\n\nFolks this isn't about money. It's about lending your liquidity for the fight. \n\nYou take the money out when the company no longer needs us. Or when you need the money to keep yourself in business. \n\nThe money you gave to the cause is likely lost forever. So when you think about selling, think about 20, 50, or even 100 years down the road. When every GameStop is just a collection of humans in egg shaped, fluid filled receptacles with tubes on our dicks and down our throats...when the GME hivemind finally manages to immerse each one of us into a permanent state of bliss and ejaculations. \n\nThat's when you sell.\n\nBy then the stock will be worth $42,069.69 (pre-split, of course).\n\nSo until then, I will just utter two final words:\n\nWe hold. \n\n\ud83d\udc8e\ud83e\udd1a"], "2021-02-19": [""], "2021-02-20": ["# This is the daily fun thread/chat. \ud83e\udd73\ud83d\ude80\n\nAll topics are permitted in this thread.\n\nSee our Monthly thread for more in-depth discussions about news/thoughts/opinions about Tesla.\n\n^((This thread should not be construed as investment advice or guidance.))"], "2021-02-21": ["Just like Google has no formidable or comparable search engine rival, and just as Apple leads by brand and profitability by a clear mile ahead of others who may even make a phone with a technically better spec sheet, TESLA will never have a \u201cnext Tesla\u201d competitor.\n\nNot Lucid.\nNot Rivian.\nNot Nikola.\nNot Nio.\n\nTesla can never be beat and will never be seen as an equal to any other brand.\n\nI\u2019m kinda cringed out by all the people who say \u201cX company is the next TSLA\u201d.... big nope.

For those who don't know (like many of you who are  new on this sub) inflation is the rise in the general price of goods. Some inflation is good for the economy and the fed target rate for inflation is 2%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here's why inflation is increasing. Obviously last year the markets dipped temporarily due to COVID-19, but since the March dip the Federal Reserve and the US government have kept the money printer printing non-stop for over a year now.  There's a ton of new money in circulation. \n\nIf you look at the M2 money stock ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2)) you'll see that nearly \\*\\*50% of all US dollars made\\*\\* were made in 2020. The US has NEVER printed this much money in it's entire history.  We've seen over $3T printed in the last year ALONE. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo why's this a problem?? Stimmy means I can gamble more money on the stock market right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you've ever taken an introductory economics class you'll know that as there becomes more of something the value of that thing goes down. If I've $1 and then suddenly everyone get $2000 from a stimmy my $1 doesn't seem so valuable now does it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is exactly what's happening with the US dollar. If this continues at this rate it'll cost you like $50 for a slice of bread or something insane like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you might be saying \"obviously this isn't going to happen because we have the Fed to control our money supply\" and you'd be right BUT what happens when inflation goes up? The way the Fed decreases the money supply (historically) has been in higher interest rates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the 1980s when inflation was at a then all time high the Fed funds rate reached nearly 16% ([https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart)). The current Fed rate has been at a historical low for the longest period EVER (since 2008).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so  high rates who cares?? \n\nThe higher the rates, the harder it is to borrow money meaning that business hire less people. This, in turn, leads to higher unemployment. In the 80s when inflation was 14% (as opposed to the target 2%) unemployment reached nearly 10.8% which was the highest since the Great Depression.  \n\nHigher rates also means monthly payments on adjustable mortgages skyrocket (cough cough 2008) \n\nOne very important thing was different between the stagflation we saw during the 80s and the stagflation we're about to see is that there wasn't a global pandemic during the 80s (except AIDs but that's different because it didn't shut down the global economy).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n There's no telling how bad this could get but we do know that we CAN NOT print our way out of this problem because that would only make it worse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Retail Retards**\n\nRetail investors have also been FLOODING the stock market and many have no idea what they're doing and are literally gambling their life savings on $TSLA FD's. This is bad. \n\nPeople gambling their life savings in the stock market is funny  on WSB, but when these same people lose their jobs and their life savings at the same time $ROPE will be mooning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Housing Market Bubble**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo obviously when interests rates rise and you're buying a house that sucks for you, but you're also fucked if you bought a house in a low rate environment (such as 2008-2020) and have an adjustable rate mortgage. \n\nNow imagine you bought a house in a low rate environment with an adjustable rate mortgage using your shitty employment history from a job that won't exist when the Fed pulls the rug AND on top of that you lost all your savings in the stock market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm willing to bet more than 1 person will be in that situation.

But I was mostly a buy and hold type of value investor so didn't look too much at the options market.\n\nIn the last 2 months, I got interested in thetagang techniques and tried it out with part of my IRA, mostly with cash-secured puts (CSP) to open up wheels. Here's some of my initial lessons learned:\n\n* **Manage your buying power**.  It can be misleading how much liquidity you have, because much of your large cash balance will be tied up in cash-secured puts.  Every week, look over your positions and free up buying power for positions that don't have much time value left in them.\n* **Stock selection matters** more than high implied volatility (IV) or even IV rank.  I naturally gravitated to solid companies that I already knew, and in general, those worked out well.  For the 2 cases I went with high IV stocks (SQ, TSLA) those didn't turn out so well - had to eat some losses to get out.\n* **Dump stocks you don't want after assignment.** If you're assigned a stock that you really wanted, no problem, start the wheel and sell out of the money (OTM) call options.  However, if you're assigned a stock that you didn't see owning long-term (maybe you got attracted to the juicy IV), sell an in-the-money (ITM) call option at (0.7) delta.  Would you have sold a -0.7 delta ITM put option to open a new cash-secured put on that stock if you didn't already own it?  That's the equivalent of owning the stock and selling a 0.3 delta OTM call. \n* **Timing matters for CSP entry.**  Have some type of technical system for entry into the cash secured put (CSP) leg of your wheel.  It could be as simple as selling CSP on a red day, or when it's over the exponential moving average, or whatever technical system you favor.  It becomes harder to profit on the wheel if the underlyer reaches the strike in the first 2 days.\n* **Avoid low-priced stocks**.  If the stock is less than $20, you'll have a hard time managing your position because the strikes will be in $1 increments on the monthlies.  This is a problem because not only do you have a harder time with targeting delta levels, the bid-ask spread on the option is wider because the market can't arbitrage the difference between the bids and asks up and down the options chain.\n* **Track your position and performance**.  Set up a worksheet so you can always see where your buying power usage, percent of max profit, P&amp;L (realized and unrealized), underlyer relative to strike, and days to expiration at a minimum.  I'm running positions on about 15 stocks, and it would be impossible to stay organized if I didn't have this.  I use Excel on Onedrive which has the nice feature of integrated stock price feeds, and it's easy to learn.\n* **Be patient**.  I haven't optimized my theta generation relative to capital, so my raw theta per day is 0.13% of the portfolio value.  That may not seem like much, but multiplied by 250 trading days, that's 33% a year.  Now, I'll probably lose a decent chunk of that to managing losing positions (I've read 25-50% of that), but that would leave a theta gain of 16-25%, significantly more than my expectations of basic buy-and-hold.\n\nI screwed up a lot in my first 2 months but got lucky and ended up with a P&amp;L that was positive by 2% over 2 months, with the first month not having much capital deployed because I was getting set up and having a few beginner screwups.\n\nI hope this helps other semi-newbies, and I'm always open feedback from those with more experience."], "2021-03-08": [""], "2021-03-09": ["In the past 6 hours on r/WallStreetBets...\n\n 1.

I deployed twice early in my career (age 17 and 19) and 100% of my income from those overseas deployments was tax free. As I was still living with my father at the time, I didn't know what to do with that money, so I just set it aside for later. \n\nA (Part Two): Between February of 2016 and April of 2017, My mother, father, grandfathers (both sides) and grandmother (mother's side) all died. It was a very difficult time, but it left me with a massive number of assets in the form of cash from life insurance, land and real estate, and other various items that I had absolutely no use for. I was the only child and grandchild so literally everything was left to me.\n\nA (Part Three): After part two happened, I threw myself into my work as a healthcare provider, working an unhealthy amount and averaging 74 hours a week in 2017 and early 2018. Money wasn't really an object in my mind, so it just kinda piled up even further.\n\n**I would not consider myself rich or even particularly wealthy, but I am acutely aware that I am in a much better situation that a lot of people, and that a lot of what I have presently was handed to me. I would enthusiastically trade what I was given as \"compensation\" for the deaths of my family to have them back.**\n\nI also wholly understand that the majority of individuals visiting r/dividends do not have $700,000 laying around to just throw into the market as they please.\n\nFeel free to double check my math as I am not particularly good at it. If you have any questions whatsoever, feel free to ask away and I will do my best to answer all of them as soon as I am able. \"Current Value\" numbers were calculated at various times throughout the day, and may not be perfectly accurate.\n\nThis post is flared as \"personal goal\", so I will write my goal here: **I intend for this portfolio to break the one million dollar mark by the end of 2021.**\n\nI hope this provides some insight into who I am, so as to create transparency and make myself more than just a shield that says **MOD- Constantly Learning**. \n\nAll the best.\n\n\\-Bdm"], "2021-03-14": ["Not a trading advise.\n\nFollowing on my comment earlier today, I asked if there was any interest in some bullshit TA for next week since the entire WSB front page is full of legit DD including all kind of mammal pictures. \n\nI\u2019m going to keep it as clean and simple as I can using area charts instead of candles. I believe support and resistances are better visible this way. It should help beginners see these levels at first sight. \n\n**Part I - Bull cases:**\n\n**SPY**\n\nPeaked through resistance and held. Common thought was resistance at 394.xx ATH while I drew my resistance line at 392.50 earlier last week. It held above 392.50 Thursday, resistance became support and whaddaya know a sharp bounce at 392.50 Friday intraday, turning green. Opened a new position on that support confirmation. 3/19 400c. If you're interested in learning charts, I recommend taking an actual look at the chart below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aim6y6vuzwm61.jpg?width=1548&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f63851b772f2bbf8cc7fd3a5cccd38d4d6f9c95f\n\n**Bull Scenario A:**\n\nSPY opens red and tests 392.50-393 Monday again, holds and closes above 396. If this plays out, we\u2019re likely see the 400 breach Tuesday intraday. I won\u2019t be spooked by the Monday dip. Might actually add. \n\n**Bull Scenario B:**\n\nNo repetitive back test. Face ripping rally above 400. \n\nWho would think folks will get their stimmy this weekend and the forbidden digital asset will trade above $60K? Honestly guys, this was kinda obvious. Not saying retail is single-handedly causing this. In my opinion, institutions anticipating this move is behind the $60K breach. I bet if we look at today\u2019s buying blocks next week, we will see double digit unit purchases dominating fraction buys. This will be the confirmation of institution involvement, bringing retail inside.\n\nAnyway,\n\n$60K+, VIX potential $20 break down, QQQ short term bottom(?) and current market momentum pointing SPY 400 Monday. Many more detailed indicators (Bullish MACD cross overs, call/put ratios, percentage of tickers above 200 moving average inside SPY etc.) supporting this but explaining them without a video is not practical. \n\nContinuing on scenario B...Test 402 Monday intraday, rejection, test 404 (actual resistance) Tuesday and a sharp rejection. This is where I\u2019m hoping to exit my 400c position and go short term \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b. Monday closing above 400 (or not) will be the deciding factor. \n\n**VIX**\n\nFellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I\u2019d like to point out that last time it was under 20 was **more than a year ago.** Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, **Bull Scenario B** will apply 100%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e7kms0qy2xm61.jpg?width=1550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=743d02ae122887214dbfcf976d2ffbb2a7f4aa0b\n\n**QQQ**\n\nI think we\u2019ve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing \ud83d\ude43 \n\nWhile QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it\u2019s going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above **Bull Scenario A or B** likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope.\n\n**TSLA**\n\nWhile 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. \n\nIn above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection.\n\nIn above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720. This level is where I\u2019m hoping to exit my 3/19 700 calls. \n\n**TNX 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD**\n\nI want to cover this part in another post under bear cases. I think bears gonna love mid next week. I will be shorting financials and oil. \n\nIf this was informative, let me know and I\u2019ll continue tomorrow holding a big ass bear flag for Part II."], "2021-03-15": ["Happy Sunday [r/Options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Options/)!\n\nBack again with this week's livestream watchlist notes!

Closest we reached was $0.74 away from our first target and that was on Thurs\n\n**$HITIF**\\----First two targets hit within the week. $0.06 cents shy of reaching the third target, but our second target is now acting as support. If that holds our third target is still doable.\n\n**$BAC**\\----Monday\u2019s candlestick failed resistance break instead of breaking through, so it didn\u2019t reach any targets. Closed Friday close to our first target and now sitting on the previous failed resistance as support so last week\u2019s targets can still be used. \n\n**$ATVI**\\----Same as BAC above. Didn\u2019t get above the 50 ema on daily and uptrend resistance like we were waiting for it to do and fell hard on Monday. It\u2019s now consolidating between our support and our first target. Should see a break to the upside soon as indicators are showing movement to the upside building up on decreasing volume  \n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  \n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  \n\n\n**Livestream Watchlist (From Viewers)**  \n\\*\\* - denotes the plays I actually like and will be watching as well \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*$RIDE:** Sitting on support on 4hr chart. Indicators look good although I\u2019m still iffy on the MACD, but it is curling up. If it holds the $14 support, then $18 is the next target (61.8% fib level acting as resistance for current price). Could also be a good play since earnings is Wednesday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$DNN:**  Daily chart setup looked great, but 4hr had a bearish reversal candlestick before it stopped trading this past Friday. I would like to see it hold $1.12 to $1.13 if it does reverse before getting in, but if it holds, I see it filling to $1.24 &gt; 1.33 &gt; 1.45.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$AQB:** Looks good as far as daily chart indicators go, but stochastics is nearing the 80 line so even if it runs a bit, it could pull back onto support at $7.46. That would be the best time to get in if that support level holds and indicators show that it\u2019s still a good play. If that holds, targets are $7.90 &gt; 8.25 &gt; 8.60 &gt; 8.84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*$UBER:** Stochastics over 80 line, MACD already curled up and heading upward, and RSI is now in uptrend on the daily chart. However, the 4hr chart is holding above a prior resistance level as support ($60.13). If that holds, we should see $61.30 &gt; 63.00 &gt; 64\n\n**$UBER Options Idea:** $60-70 strikes, 16 April 2021 exp date look like a decent play. Lots of volume and OI\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*$AM:** Daily indicators look iffy, but 4hr chart looks a lot better. Either way, price action is above an uptrend support level. If that holds, we should fill up towards $9.70 because it\u2019s trading within a rising wedge pattern (bullish). Then we can look for continuation if it breaks up and out.\n\n**$AM Options Idea:** $10 strike, 16 Apr 2021 exp, current ask is $0.30, lots of volume and OI as well. This is a safe play imo because it\u2019s not far from strike price, the underlying moves pretty decently as long as we give ourselves time, and we have a month from exp.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$PLTR:** Returning from our watchlist last week...Still looks great for a swing play going off volume and indicators (excluding stochastics) on the daily chart. Try to get in as close to $26 as possible as that\u2019s support IF the $27 price level doesn\u2019t hold. If that $27 holds, that\u2019s our support, and then I\u2019d shoot for $28-29 as our targets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  \n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  \n\n\n**Tickers We\u2019re Still Watching From Last Week**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$BA:** Put alert out last Thurs to ride the continuation of the resistance breakout on the Daily chart. Sold to secure profit Friday morning, but BA kept going up throughout the afternoon and into AH. Could still play continuation to our first target before we sold out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$NFLX:** Put alert out after seeing unusual options volume, analyzing chart, and seeing great setup. Ran over 100% the same day I alerted it, but held because of no day trades. Still up 30% on calls. Will look to add if it gains more movement or secure profit if it starts to show weakness and look for reentry.  \n\n\n**$TSLA:** Ate a hard loss after NASDAQ took a beating last Friday. Still holding calls and will look to avg down and scalp it at the open or swing it longer. Will see how price action goes.  \n\n\n**$AMD:** Put alert out after seeing same setup as NFLX, currently up 14% on these so, again, will add on strength or sell on weakness and look for reentry.\n\n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  \n**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nDisclaimer: This information is for educational and entertainment purposes only.

The past week we have seen strategic gap openings to utilize the gamma ramp. 16 is our next prize.\n\n8. At a certain point the short interest will be untenable and margins will get called.\n\n12.

Essentially temporarily cut off from their supply lines of support, Longs struck a retreat, pulled the backstops and ran with the price down to what it opened at.  While the prices of options cratered, someone bought a fuckton of hyper cheap 15$ calls and closed them out.  This is either\n\n* A - A market maker looking for a good deal on hedging some short positions\n* B - A Ronin slipping in to scalp the fruits of war.\n* C - The short interest essentially turning states witness and hedging their outstanding short interest at a price 90 cents higher than the current share price.\n\nThe SP stabilized **at the opening price**.  The effect of this in my option would be like catching the sword blade while it is being swung at you bare handed, snapping it off and throwing it their face.\n\nLongs effectively told shorts, \" You're not in control, you just think you are. You just spent 500k or more on that and we are still going to close green. Bitch\"\n\n\"I'll see you at the bike racks on Monday after stimmie check Christmas.\"\n\nWe are now in an active fight.  Expect it to get messy.  This isn't just spend money and win. 8 million shares at a sp of 17 is **136 million dollars** they stand to lose at the very least. People have been murdered for way less.  Don't expect them to go down without a fight.  You wouldn't just walk away either.\n\nListen, the 16 is a magic number. I am not going to tell you what to do but after friday, that portion of the gamma ramp is done.  If we are not over 16 sooner rather than later, I feel differently about my 3/19 options than I did last week.\n\nThat isn't to say that I am highly fucking bullish about this play.  The amount of gambling tier call options being purchased at open will be astounding and I think in the end we will be victorious.\n\n# Lets Fucking Go\n\n# \n\nEdit 1 - This will be the post for the week unless something dramatic happens I'll update the ortex daily.\n\nEdit 2 - Keep in mind what you would do to keep from losing 200 million dollars that you did have and what you would do to win 200 million that you didn't are two different things.

Everything disclosed in the post was done by myself, with public information. I came to my own conclusions, as should you.\n\nSo to start I will give a very short background about myself. I go by the name DeMartini Millionaire, I started out my investing career as a retail investor and last year I was able to quickly grow my portfolio through $TSLA &amp; $FLGT. I got into GameStop after the second (spike) and was able to accumulate 700,000 shares at a great price of $48 per share roughly (34M USD). Now I didn't come from a wealth family or have anything handed to me. I worked hard for everything I have, and I'm extremely proud of what I have accomplished. I also am involved in politics and know and work with some very elite politicians. With that being said this particular DD will stick with GameStop and I will make another DD with the political and religious aspect of everything!\n\nSo to start things off why am I involved in Gamestop? Well to answer that, the same reason why all you apes are! I want financial reform in are country but also around the world. And as are market stands now it is by no means a \"free and fair\" market, it is controlled by hedge funds, the elite 1% in the world, and the Central Bank! We already know the obvious hedge funds involved within this GameStop story! (Citadel, Marvin Capital, etc...) But of course to make money... that's why most people start investing anyway. Now for those asking what is going on we obviously know that these hedge funds are shorting $GME to oblivion whether it is the stock itself or through ETF's and [u/atobitt](https://www.reddit.com/u/atobitt/) post \"Citadel Has No Clothes\" does a very good job on explaining how it works and what is happening! IMPORTANT: The END result of all this will cause one of the greatest depressions are economy has ever seen... And just to put into perspective, we try to compare the 2008 crisis to the events unfolding now... but this has already had a much greater impact than that... and we haven't even gotten started... Are economy is at the strongest point it has ever been... but those that are really educated on the matter at hand know it is extremely overbought.... that being said it would take a very large event to occur in order to collapse are financial system! That is why $GME $EXPR $AMC $NOK $GNUS just to name a few will ultimately play apart in this crisis (destroying the economy). Now some might want my opinion on what the \"floor will be\" TBH I along with anybody else cannot tell you... this will be a Infinite Short Squeeze and the \"floor\" will be set by YOU as well as the good INSTITUTIONS! WARNING: When the first take off happens the hedge funds will \"let you win\" for a little period of time meaning when the price hits 10k-15k they are hoping that most of you will think that's as high as it will get, and hope you will sell being content with the money you would make... therefore there will be another flash crash back down to $200... but if all you apes hold and dont paper hand, and survive THERE LAST BIT OF AMMO, the reward will be the greatest thing you have ever seen! And not saying GameStop will hit 1M per share but that would make $GME over a 70 Trillion $ company, In terms of are economy that is not enough to crash are market to never before seen levels... keep that in mind! Now I know some might want all the proof or evidence of all this information... there are many posts out there that have said proof. I am providing my take and stance in this DD! And will make another DD with the political and religious side of everything with proof and evidence that most have not seen before!\n\nTo wrap everything up my current position in $GME is 715,000 shares with a average of $51.948 and I will continue to buy and hold until this squeeze has squoze!! And I am by no means doing this for publicity or to \"be famous\" or whatever my haters would like to call it. I am just another man at the end of each and every day, that wants only the best for myself, my family, and everyday people just like you and myself! And with all of you we will achieve such status and make life changing and historic changes never before seen. I do know this account is fairly new, and that is because I have been banned numerous times, on nearly every platform, because of political reasons (will be discussed in next DD) so before you call me fake or think im spitting bullshit, know that I am a well know person supporting a good cause that goes against a corrupt system and they have tried/and been successful numerous times at silencing me! And I have recently hired a media team to help make and establish my media presence, So there will hopefully be multiple ways for communication with me, and for me to communicate to you. I am not DeepFuckingValue, but I do have respect for him because it is hard to throw this kind of money at a war! With all being said I wish my fellow apes the best and keep Diamond Handing!!!\n\n\\-DeMartini\n\nWeBull: DeMartiniMillionaire\n\nEmail: [demartinimillionairebusiness@gmail.com](mailto:demartinimillionairebusiness@gmail.com)\n\nReddit: DemartiniMillionaire\n\nTwitter: TBH"], "2021-04-27": [], "2021-04-28": [], "2021-04-29": [], "2021-04-30": [], "2021-05-01": ["\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/n2b40c)"], "2021-05-02": [], "2021-05-03": [], "2021-05-04": [], "2021-05-05": [], "2021-05-06": [], "2021-05-07": [""], "2021-05-08": [], "2021-05-09": [], "2021-05-10": [], "2021-05-11": [], "2021-05-12": ["OG post was from WSB-\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nabs68/tsla\\_dd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nabs68/tsla_dd/)\n\nIt was posted here earlier and commented on but douche finally replied to my comment so here is that thread-\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nabs68/tsla\\_dd/gxtfihe?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nabs68/tsla_dd/gxtfihe?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nPeople with a bit of knowledge can pull market data, technicals, news and spew fud which we all know.
