Lately I've been thinking about it more and more which (I think) is kind of a bigger step towards my (possible) future sobriety. With thinking about it more and more I've been trying to think why I always want to drink. I think tonight I've realized that it's to dull my feelings. I know you're probably thinking \"well ya, no shit.\" But honestly I never realized this. I thought it was just about having a good time. But the more I think about it the more I think I'm starting to see my true intentions. I grew up in a very hostile household. My parents were always drunk, high, tweaked, etc. In the beginning it was just my dad so my mom would vent to me. I can't tell you how many days/nights I spent trying to calm down my mom. Mind you I was around 10 at the time. The whole time I'm trying to calm her down, I myself am also dealing with an alcoholic/high father and trying not to break down and cry with her. It went on for years until moved out at 18. This kind of taught me to never show my emotions and it desensitized me. I never truly let anyone know how I'm REALLY feeling and I just deal with my demons myself and it's fucking killing me.\nOutside of a funeral, the only time I can cry is if I get completely shitfaced. Then everything just pours out at once and I totally fuck up the night. It's a lose lose for everyone. I so desperately wish that I could go out with my friends and have a few beers and enjoy the night but there's always a tipping point amd then I'm just a mess.\n\nI'm saying all of this to just say this: I think I need therapy. I think I have a deeper problem and I'm just medicating with drinking. To be clear, I'm well aware that that's not healthy. But if I were to be totally sober I would be in the same boat I'm in now. Not expressing my feelings and dealing with all of my pent up anger/depression/anxiety by myself until I finally snap. I just found out I have a lump in my testicle and I'll have to have it removed. This scares the living shit out of me and the only people that know are my mom, my fiance, and her mother. I haven't said anything to anyone else because it's not a conversation I want to have. Just an example of me running from my problems instead of facing them.\n\nI love this little community so damn much. I don't feel so alone anymore and it helps me a lot. Thank you.\n\nNot sure why I posted this but it does feel good to let it out. Maybe someone can see it and realize that they have a problem deeper than drugs/alcohol. \n\nStay strong everyone."], "2020-10-05": ["Hey!

It seems to be an issue this sub is getting flooded with, including one I'm experiencing myself, so I wanted to make a groupthink post on how to fix it, including any solutions we have to date. As such, they are...  \n\n**Description of issue: After launching (from launcher or the direct .exe) the game immediately becomes unresponsive.**\n\n**Things we know don't work, so don't suggest them-**\n- Re-installing\n- Running as admin\n- Turning off firewall\n- Verifying game files\n\n\n\n# Possible Solutions \n\n\nu/xkorzen\n\n&gt; Change to DirectX - cog wheel next to play button.\n\n\n(For some this seems to fix it. For many this fixes A LOT of issues- similar to problems with RDR2, the Vulkan API version seems to be causing a lot of issues. However, may be unrelated to this specific issue.)\n\n\nu/ecish\n&gt; I commented before but I just found a fix for me that someone posted on steam. Download visual studio redistros x64 and x86 from Microsoft then restart your system. I don\u2019t know much about it but I was getting desperate so I tried and it worked.\n\n[Latest link to this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) Didn't work for me, but it might work for others as it did u/ecish\n\n\nu/gunnerrat\n\n&gt; What I found is you have to have at least driver version 440 for Nvidia. Anything before that won't work. Attempting to update previously got me an 'update failed' error. I tried it again, this time without GeForce experience and I at least got the driver to update.\n&gt; You can launch dx 11 exe directly: \\steamapps\\common\\Baldurs Gate 3\\bin\\bg3_dx11.exe. I can't get anything else to work for me. This combination works for me. I'm surprised Larian failed to mention needing version 440 or higher.\n\n(Others have claimed driver updates help, but others say it did not change the end result. If the launcher itself is crashing, I can certainly see using the exact bg3_dx11.exe working)\n\nu/Fausterion18\n\n&gt; Guys I just figured out the fix to the launch crash for windows 7. Here's what you need to do.\n&gt; Go to your install folder for the game (mine is I:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Baldurs Gate 3). DELETE THE LAUNCHER FOLDER. Now find bg3.exe in the bin folder. Right click and run the game as administrator, ignore the error steam gives you, the game will now run without the launcher.\n&gt; I also installed the latest microsoft C++ updates but I'm not sure if that had any effect. If the above doesn't work try installing these updates:\n&gt; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads\n\n(I'm yet to try this myself, as if the fix is incorrect it'll prompt a re-install, which I don't really want to do at the moment.)\n\n\n# My own anecdote\n\nThe game itself launches every few dozen or so times I attempt it, but all other times it simply becomes unresponsive. Computer specs for those effected seem completely unrelated, from NVIDA cards to AMD. High end to low. Personally, I am running on Win7 so I figured that was related, but most issues are also coming from Win10.  \n\n\nWhile there are many posed solutions, for others, such as myself, these solutions are inadequate. Larian hasn't responded to any tweets on the issue. Naturally, the game just got released.\n\n\nAnyone with any suggestions, please comment below :) I will include it in my post (assuming anyone can say it helped them)."], "2020-10-08": ["###Troubleshooting Help:\n\n**What is your parts list?

After grade 4 she moved again and same story we still talked but not as much as in grade 2.

Now um in my first year of highschool (grade 8) and me and my bsf and her talk together a lot, so me amd her start talking and texting a lot and slowly i started calling her \"luv\" as a joke (\ud83d\ude02 i at the time was fanboying captin price) and after a while she started too, i had a hunch that she liked me but didnt want to ruin our friendship, when i told my best friend about this he asked \"well do you like her back?\" And at that moment i realised that i did, later that day she confessed and i also did. She goes to a different school than me still, and today our district had a pro d day (basically students get the day off, while the teachers have meetings and stuff) and we dicided to meet w the bsf and her, we had a great time just hanging out.

And it explains the lengths i had to go with NO help and being sucked dry. When i acknowledged the mindfuck in the relationships and control issues ive been through, i look back and say holy shit i could write it out and get it off my chest...Because now i see that i have a history or pattern for falling for abusers. Or i somehow have a target on my back. I feel indebted to having reddit for being able to speak the truth in black and white, albeit years later. This happened between a span of 2 years in 2014-2016. In every situation i was in I felt excruciatingly hopeful and helpless, like if you were drowning and was hoping someone would reach in from above and pull you to the surface for air. Every step i take to heal is painfully slow and fast at the same time. He was a mistake but a good story. It all sounds exaggerated however its not flared with exaggerations. If anything, I am only summarizing so the emotional turmoil and events that lead up before and the following lash outs aren't fully described. Only the hard events remain in the memory bank. I'm so emotionally wrecked that i haven't been able to to eat properly for days except for small light snacks periodically to satisfy the slight hunger due to currently being in an abusive situation and working on getting out appropriately. So without further adieu, heres my story. \n\nI met him through a friends get together and we instantly hit it off. I was seeing someone at the time but i felt that he was 'the one'. It was magical when we sat outside leaving the stifling atmosphere and drunkenly talked for hours until the sun rose. That's how i met him. Then the talk came around him living by himself and that he was embarrassed with his place because it was baaad and admitted that he needed help.\nIt was disgusting! He really needed my help! He was charming and witty and i fell for him so i ended up breaking up with the other guy i was with.\nI cleaned the place when we first dated. He said he needed help and i said i was gonna help so i did. I was eating takeout at his place one time before the clean and one roach crawled into the food when it was placed on the floor, still in the bag.\n\n I pulled out approximately 48 pizza boxes hidden in the closet alone, some with slices still intact and petrified, always covered in a swarm of roaches. It may have been more as there were stacks under the futon and in various other places.\n\nI cleaned and killed like the dickens, traps everywhere filling up before you could blink twice. He was and probably is still living with a massive amount of cockroaches in the apartment, if he ever moved out. He was living with a broken sink for 4 years before i showed up. He was afraid to tell the landlord. I coaxed him into telling the landlord and got it fixed immediately. He periodically used the bathtub to wash his hands, if he ever bothered. He almost never used toilet paper, just a watering can. \n\n He had wine bottles and booze cans and liquor bottles hidden everywhere. I think it came out to approximately 120$ or more of empties. I wanted to return them myself because i needed money. I was planning on carrying approximately 10$ a day on my back and buggy and bring them to the beer store 6 blocks away. They ended up being taken from me behind my back from his mother, given to a lady in a different unit because she had a car, saying \"shes less fortunate, she needed it more. His mother comes into the story later on. I was almost flat broke at the time, struggling to find a job. \n \nHe barely showered and i did too at one point later in the relationship to just chameleon or understand his situation. We cared for each other at the time and he gave me a key to his place. \n\nThis guy drank a lot. He would work from home and sling back a 1.5L wine during work. It was a cup at first and escalated the longer i lived in his place.\nHis attitude changed over time. He became a bully, possessive, aggressive, and i always felt that he distanced himself constantly in his computer gaming. I couldn't join because he only had one pc so i had to cook or continue cleaning or take care of the puppy i brought into the place, which was before we started dating. I picked, paid, and covered 100% of her vet bills beside walking her constantly. I took her everywhere, even to the dteak house he brought me to, hidden in a bag. We were smokers and i felt like i had fallen into a spiral of chain smoking, always having to have a smoke between my fingers to distract myself.\n\nHe would force me awake in the middle of the night to cook for him, especially on days i had to work and only had less then 5 hours to myself when i walked through the door till i had to leave. He kept me confined in the bedroom while he worked. Verbally attacked me for being in the space topless. I had to \"warn\" him if i stepped out of the room. \n\n I made beautiful artwork and i hung it as a mosaic of various photographs and drawings and paintings on the wall. He trashed my artwork on new years after an argument. It was over a McDonald's order, when he grabbed the wrong one when drunk. After the trashing he then forced me to sleep in the same bed beside him that night i was breaking and terrified. I gave him chances and almost broke up, his sweet words of promise the next day kept me wary but still in the picture. \n\nThen his mom came to visit from dubai. Basically he wanted me in the place for my expedited services to clean the nesting pigeons off his balcony, roaches, garbage debris, etc. For the weeks i cleaned, she showed up and scoffed at the clean up i did which compared to her cushy dubai apartment, was not enough. She hired another person in the apartment to clean, which they didnt really do much except wash the curtains and random sweeping after i swept. She paid them to sit in the laundromat. She thanked this random woman amd gave her approx 1,000$. To me, a random scarf she got at the gift shop at the airport. \nThen the pork incident happened. \nWhile she was over we went out for breakfast and i brought mine back. It had bacon but i ate it all and couldnt finish it. She had a weird habit of trying to dispose of the metal cutlery. I politely asked her not to after i finished my meals. My half eaten breakfast was in the fridge with no bacon in sight. When i had my back turned, she threw out the food and bowl whole but left the cutlery in the sink. I fished it out of the garbage and asked why. She said it had pork so she tossed it but kept the fork like if it was the unwritten rule of a passive aggressive statement. She stuttered something about religion and i laughed and said her son eats pork all the time. How dare she feels entitled to throw out other peoples belongings without consent. She tried to give an excuse and i laughed. She humphed and declared i could not live there with her. Her son conceded and basically kicked me out to keep the peace since i could stay at my parents place. I found out he shit talked about me to his parents. Let his mom verbally abuse me. After she left, i was with my parents on a short trip. He cheated on me. I found the condom in the bed behind the pillow, which i confronted him with it. He said his friends stayed over and had hanky panky. I was close to my breaking point. He got me knocked up at some point so i got an abortion. He manipulated his words that i had to stay with him at a crucial point in time with my fathers illness. Belittled the time i had left with my dying father. My dad died soon after. Then blamed me for making those choices and that i made that decision and acted on it. I broke down. I broke up with him. \n\nHe threatened suicide so i let him hold onto the dog which he refused first, since he wouldnt kill himself if the dog had to be taken care of, right? Wrong. He registered her to the city of toronto behind my back and made sure to do stupid vet visits to get paperwork. Then called the cops to try to get a restraining order. Of course he was denied but because he called first i had to take him to court to prove it. I had no money. He spent it behind my back. I lost my job from battling and recovering from a extreme case of chronic dermatitis which made me walk like an old person because when i took a step all my joints would rip and bleed and cause open sores. My skin would adhere to clothing or bedsheets, ripping my skin right off, infusing to the cloth when i woke up in the morning. I used all my sick days and i was late because walking to the subway to work took agonizing steps. They didnt like me using the medical bandages to wrap my skin when it was too painful to move. My skin looked like i came back from vacation, dark and peeling, so no one took me seriously. To this day the false claim i had was streppococcous bacterium on the skin. He just gave me some steroids to speed up the recovery process and ignored me after that. In the future i had to visit the hospital 3 more times to get treated for this.\n\n He stole my dog. Then, with my stuff still in the place, he got a new girlfriend to move in a week later. I had to get the cops to stand guard while he shuffled my stuff into the hallway. I could not go in to recover things afterwards, just tell them verbally through the hallway what was missing in my memory recollection. \nWhen i went i would never see the dog or hear her. He took her to his friends apartment if i was ever around, which i did not know the location to. \nPhysically sick, emotionally broken and abused, grieving, loss of my only pet, loss of my two years of life, dazed, etc. All of this was happening.

But I had never imagined this. Kneeling in nothing but my green heels, white gloves and stockings, and my crown.

I had no idea how long this had been going on, but by how soar my knees were it felt like I had been kneeling for hours.

So as I felt his lust filled gaze on the back of my head. I did the only thing I could and mumbled into his cock. \"Slurrp Thranksh ssshyou slurrrp mhyyy lhoord.\" (Thank you my lord) As I finish mumbling into his cock. I felt his cock give a few twitches before he let out a loud grunt. And my mouth filled with his cum. Caught by surprise and with a complete lack of experience, his flood of jizz leaked passed my lips. Coating my chin and breast in a waterfall of hot cum. \n\nI could barely hear him as he laugh and talked about how that would do till our next appointment.

Please help"], "2020-12-10": ["So I just went through a month+ process whereby at first my system was as follows (tl;dr at the bottom for those who don't want to read the story):\n\n8700k OC 4.9ghz\n\n32gb 3200mhz CL16 RAM\n\n2060 Super lightly OC'd (don't remember exactly how much)\n\nI would average around 90-120 fps in warzone (1080P LOW settings) and not really think much of it, seemed normal to me and was playable.\n\nThen I managed to score a 3090 and excitedly installed it only to realize that my FPS only kind of increased to around 130-140 average but on all highest settings (1080P still), with literally no change in FPS if I changed the settings to all lowest. This seemed odd to me as most streamers and other benchmarks I've seen with the 3090 are able to realize 200+ average FPS.\n\nI did almost everything I could think of or find on the internet. I formatted and did a fresh windows install, tried all the optimizations including power, adv. config, etc., with no dice, my FPS was stuck here.\n\nCreated a few reddit threads and most people pointed me to the fact that I was CPU-bound, which I accepted could have been true but didn't explain how benchmarkers on youtube were able to achieve 200+ fps with 8700k's and 3080's.\n\nOh and I might add that at 4k res (which relies much more heavily on GPU-performance), I was basically within 2-3% of benchmarks in warzone, so no problems there although I don't play on a 4k monitor.\n\nEarlier this week I was able to secure a 5800x and figured ok, now finally I will be able to achieve the mythical 200fps average.. only to once again fall short now in the 150-180fps range.\n\nBy matter of chance... my original plan was to give my GF the majority of my old PC while swapping the RAM since she already had 16gb and I figured my 32gb 3200mhz was more than good enough. However, her system was pretty old and still running on DDR3 so the RAM wasn't compatible, and  therefore I had to purchase new ram.\n\nConventional wisdom historically has always been that RAM speed isn't that impactful on performance, specifically game performance or FPS, but this is where I get to my \"ah ha\" realization.\n\nIt's been somewhat well established since Ryzen 3000 that Ryzen CPUs specifically are very sensitive to RAM speeds and you can achieve much greater discrepancy in performance based on different RAM (most of the popular youtubers have done vids on this). Furthermore, Gamersnexus recently posted a video about how not only is Ryzen sensitive to RAM speeds, but there is a significant performance uplift (or downtick, depending on where you're coming from) on the same exact RAM with 4 or 2 sticks.\n\nSo I then proceeded to purchase 64gb 3600mhz CL16 RAM (4x16gb) and boom.. my FPS instantly increased to 200-220fps average (hitting as high as 240-260fps in some map locations). I checked some of the benchmark rigs that I was looking at before and sure enough all of them were running on at least 3600mhz RAM.\n\nI then proceeded to do a number of underclocks (and attempted overclocks, to no avail) on my RAM with multiple iterations in controlled environments (same spot, same path, etc.) and came to the following results with my current system (5800x stock, 64gb RAM, 3090 FE slightly OC'd):\n\nThe FPS difference between 2133mhz RAM (no XMP), and 3600mhz RAM is a whopping  24% on average and 30% on max FPS at 1080P highest settings. The difference between 3200mhz and 3600mhz is 13%. Assuming you are not GPU bottlenecked, I can only assume the variance would be greater at lower settings. That is a HUGE discrepancy for just RAM, which most people ignore other than the size.\n\nI tested a few other games and generally it seems (and makes sense) that more CPU-intensive and bound games benefit tremendously from higher RAM speeds (CS:GO for example). Also mostly at 1080p, at higher resolutions the variance decreases and becomes less meaningful.\n\nWarzone out of any game I tested was the MOST sensitive to changes in RAM speeds.\n\nFinally I would point out that for AMD Ryzen processors, RAM speed actually is a deterrent past 4000mhz (you lose FPS) and you'd need a bit of a win on the silicon lottery side to even effectively make use of that much. Won't get into the tech here of why that is but you can do your own research. The sweet spot is 3600 --&gt; 3800mhz.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\nWarzone FPS is HIGHLY dependent on your RAM speed, which can generally be upgraded for less than a new CPU (which often requires a new MOBO) or a new GPU (which is impossible to find right now anyways)..

NVIDIA's default settings had me at 40 fps for most of the game, so this is a big improvement with no noticeable visual downgrade. I'm running an R5 3600, 3060 Ti, and 16 GB Ram.\n\nFirst: Apply the AMD processor fix described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/kbtuec/possible_cyberpunk_2077_on_amd_cpus_performance/) for a significant FPS increase on AMD CPUs\n\nSettings:\n\nStart at RayTracing Ultra preset and change the following settings:\n\n* Cascaded Shadow Range to Medium\n* Cascaded Shadow Resolution to Medium\n* Volumetric Fog Resolution to High\n* Volumetric Cloud Quality to High\n* Max Dynamic Decals to High\n* DLSS - Quality\n\nDepending on your CPU, you may want to turn crowd density in the Gameplay settings to Medium.  I would recommend it with an R5 3600 for a 5-10 fps increase in the most crowded city areas of the game. If you're looking for even more FPS gains, the next thing to drop would probably be Volumetric Fog and Clouds to Medium.\n\nSettings I turned off based on preference:\n\n* Film Grain off\n* Chromatic Aberration off\n* Depth of Field off\n* Motion Blur off\n\nHope this helps!  The main thing that makes this game pop is the ray-traced lighting in my opinion, so I've tried to cut the visuals where it's less noticeable to keep the game running smooth with RTX on."], "2020-12-14": ["Hi all!\n\nI'm not sure if this has been asked here before or not. Please do forgive me if this has been asked and answered a zillion times and just kindly link me to the current working solution.\n\nSo, I've just downloaded Cyberpunk 2077 on GOG Galaxy today, with the latest patch and all. I decided not to have a go at it on launch day after hearing about the terrible performance everywhere, and I also didn't really have any time to spare to play. But, I figured that maybe after a few days and a few patches, the game would at least be somewhat playable.\n\nAnyway, I have got the latest available driver for the 6900XT, version 20.12.1 according to Radeon Software, and I have got the latest chipset driver as well for my X570 motherboard, version  2.10.13.408 according to AMD's website.\n\nI only have a 1080p monitor at the moment, but an upgrade to 1440p/4K is imminent, but I'm still undecided yet between 1440p and 4K. I tested different resolutions, however, between 1080p, 1440p, and 2160p, using the virtual super resolution feature and I can set FidelityFX dynamic rendering to off, making the GPU technically rendering the full virtual resolution of my choice.\n\nAcross all resolutions, I only see cinematic 25-35 fps at max graphical settings, as chosen by Cyberpunk for my hardware. There are no RT features enabled yet for AMD cards, so, this is with RT off. This already is an unusual behavior as the performance basically doesn't scale with the resolution at all.\n\nI also notice that at 1080p, my GPU is cool as a cucumber at 50C with a usage of at most 25%. At 1440p, it goes up a bit higher at 35% peak, and at 4K it goes even higher at 55% peak. But it never pins the GPU at 100% and the core clock is just everywhere.\n\nDoes anybody have any idea what to do in this case or how to fix it? Aside from waiting for the CDPR to fix it or AMD to release new drivers of course..."], "2020-12-15": ["I've never built a PC myself. I did a couple of part-swappings in a pre-built PC so I kinda had the idea what to do, but this is the first time I ever actually did it.  \nPreviously I was using a i5-6600 barebone kit with no GPU, which the fans literally starts screaming any time I launch any game. The recently-released Genshin Impact simply crashed on it. And with a new remake of MYST coming along the way, I decided to build a new one from scratch.\n\nThis is the result of 3 months of lurking in this sub and some Youtube channels.\n\nPart list (Note: I live in Japan so some of them might appear obscure)   \nCPU\t\tAMD Ryzen5 3600\t\t\t\t\t$253\t\u00a526,378   \nGPU\t\tPalit GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER GP OC\t$240\t\u00a524,980  \nMB\t\t\tGIGABYTE B450I AORUS PRO WIFI\t\t$129\t\u00a513,472   \nRAM\t\tCFD 8Gx2 3200MHz\t\t\t\t\t$71\t\t\u00a57,376  \nPSU\t\tCoolerMaster V650 SFX Gold\t\t\t$139\t\u00a514,498   \nCPU Cooler\tSCYTHE Choten\t\t\t\t\t\t$34\t\t\u00a53,498   \nCase\t\tCoolerMaster NR200\t\t\t\t\t$79\t\t\u00a58,259   \nSSD\t\tSAMSUNG 970 EVO M.2 (500GB)\t\t$86\t\t\u00a58,980  \nPlus a 2.5 HDD and a 2.5 SSD from my old PC.\n\nThe RAM runs 2666MHz out of the box, and comes with an XMP profile to boost to 3200MHz, which I applied.\n\nI didn't add any case fans except the 92+120 that came with the case. 92 is on the back, exhausting. 120 was too thick to fit above the CPU cooler, so it sits above the PSU instead, exhausting. All fans are set to silent mode in BIOS.  \nI didn't do any proper benchmarks, but when playing Genshin Impact with all graphic set to the highest, both CPU and GPU sits around 55-60C which I'm fairly comfortable with. Maybe I'll add some fans next summer.  \nI did notice though, that CPU tends to jump from 45C-ish to 60C-ish, and back to 45C-ish again. I'm not sure if this is normal since this is the first time I ever monitored the temps.\n\nAt first I was aiming for an absolutely no LED build, since I wasn't a big fan of it. But after seeing the white LED of GPU leaking from the mesh panel, I decided to keep it. The back of MB glows in white as well.\n\nCable management was somewhat problematic because of the 2 SATA drives. The cables that came with the PSU were also very stiff, so all I could do was to pretty much tuck them away and pray that they won't affect the air flow.  \nThey WILL be more of a problem when I try to add fans at the bottom in the future though..."], "2020-12-16": [" paypal only. acquired through AMD Raise The Game Promo.

The second time I tried getting into the game,  it says previous launch was unsuccessful, would you like to start in safe mode?

Can someone please tell me how to fix this?"], "2020-12-27": ["**The Background:**\n\nSo recently my pc of 8 years started getting small burning smells and started not being able to hold a stable overclock. Given that it's likely the psu or the motherboard, and given the current shortages/used market prices, I decided to finally upgrade after managing to get about $500 from friends and family.\n\nOnly problem? Because I genuinely cannot afford to set aside any other money for this, I have to kind of get creative with my build setup. My pc space only has about 2 feet squared of space next to it so I had a mini-itx build for a long time. Unfortunately, I tried pricing out all kinds of mini itx builds so I could reuse my case but all of them were way over budget. Then I tried looking at what kind of cases were available for my uses but every single one would go over the budget I had and I didn't want to sacrifice the psu quality/upgrade paths or the ram which I need for a few projects I'm working on (blender, handbrake, video editing, etc) so that wasn't an option either. \n\nIn my parents' old house, I saw they had one of those small couch dinner tables they were planning on throwing out and suddenly got an idea. After test-fitting it in the space of my pc, I realized it would fit perfectly. Now my new plan is to just build an open-air test bench where I would just run the pc on my motherboard box but also at the same time use the front IO and optical drive of my old case. \n\n**The Plan:**\n\nSo I have the couch table next to my tiny desk, the case on my desk, and the computer would be placed on top of the motherboard box on the table. The case I have is a Corsair 250D mini itx cube, and the side panels are able to be put on in a way where they aren't flush with the case. This leaves *just* enough room for a few cables to come out. My plan was to get a cheap set of front IO extension cables, route them through the side of the case through that small opening, connect them to my motherboard, then connect my hdd and optical drive through a small hole in the bottom of the case at the front. I checked the sizing and it's just enough room to pass through a couple sata cables and power cables. Then I would \"mount\" the ssd on the side of the motherboard box using some velcro or similar, let the gpu be free-standing (horrible idea, but I will get a brace for it when I can), and get a longer monitor cable for my gpu to connect it to my monitor since my setup would likely see the rear of the gpu facing forward rather than back. [Here's an extremely crude visualization of what I had in mind.](https://i.imgur.com/m6WcqFy.png) Note that I can fit the psu on the table too but it would be behind the motherboard and I didn't have a good way of showing that/was too lazy to mess with layers in GIMP. \n\n**The Unsure Of Myself**\n\nIs there anything I'm not considering in this? I won't have a direct way to cool the VRMs given the lack of case airflow, I assume this will get dusty over time, and the entire thing will be pretty fragile overall.

Sure, we all know that you buy glasses when you're unable to see,  [revision capsules review](https://apnews.com/press-release/ts-newswire/nutrition-north-america-lifestyle-health-eye-health-b0864b27d689bbb5c72b10a054e99854)  but what more is there? If you want to learn all about caring for your eyes the right way, the tips and tricks found in this article will be sure to help you out.\n\nYou should wear sunglasses as often as possible. Sunglasses are more than just a fashion statement, they're a source of much-needed protection from the sun. Sunglasses block Ultra-Violet radiation, which can cause serious and long-term damage to the eye. Sunglasses can even prevent wrinkles and cancer from forming around the eye!\n\nWear sunglasses to help keep your eyes protected from sun light. Keep ones that have really good UV safety features with you at all times. The sun can injure your eyes and the delicate skin which surrounds them. Do not take risks with your eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1e8vol71v761.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2992e5649f9d238b1fdea6198d80c11b9ebf91dc\n\nDon't smoke. You probably already know that there are many serious dangers related to cigarette smoking. One of the less-known dangers is developing Age-related Macular Degeneration(AMD). Several scientific studies have shown that the patients who did smoke were much more likely to develop AMD than those who didn't smoke. Just another reason not to start smoking or to quit today.\n\nWhen selecting an eye care  [improve eye vision](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/features/natural-vision-correction-does-it-work#1)  professional, do not skimp when it comes to doing your homework on each prospective doctor's qualifications. Check their educational background, certifications and licensure to ensure that everything is as represented. Doing these things will help you feel confident when it comes to entrusting the health of your eyes to someone new.\n\nDrink plenty of water to keep your eyes hydrated. Your eyes are made mostly of water, and they need to stay moist at all times to remain healthy. Dry eyes are more prone to eye problems and diseases. Keeping your body fully hydrated will ensure that your eyes stay moisturized.\n\nWhat you consume effects your eye health. Look for foods with vitamin C and E, as well as foods that have zinc and omega-3 fatty acids. They can ward off things like macular degeneration and cataracts. You can consume foods such as beans, nuts, tuna, salmon and oranges which all have these healthy nutrients.\n\nDon't strain the eyes for too long. When you strain your vision and focus on something, such as a computer or television screen, you typically forget to blink as much as you should. When you don't blink enough, it means your eyes are getting the lubrication they need, which can lead to more serious problems.\n\nIf you suffer from dry eyes, this can be painful. You may want to try a high quality saline drop. In addition, little things, such as blinking, can increase tear production. Try to avoid using products that are filled with chemicals. Over time, these may actually worsen your dry eyes.\n\nWear good sunglasses.   [revision supplement review](https://apnews.com/press-release/ts-newswire/nutrition-north-america-health-eye-health-dietary-supplements-1f9a700a2f57a435bac6898a08434671)  This helps keep the UV rays from harming your eyes when out in the sun. Choose a pair that blocks 99 to 100 percent of both UVA and UVB rays. If you enjoy driving, polarized lenses are important. They also help you reduce glare. Sunglasses are still a good idea, even with the right contacts.\n\nIf you are a smoker, butt out! Of course, smoking will lead your eyes to yellow and the skin around them to wrinkle and thin. On top of that, smoking is linked to a high risk of macular degeneration, cataracts and even damage to the optic nerve, all of which can lead to blindness.\n\nAre you now prepared to care for your eyes to ensure they support you for many more years? If so, take these tips and use them to make changes in your life. The sooner you better your eye care agenda, the better the results will be once you implement it."], "2020-12-29": ["Geforce gtx 1660  , amd ryzen 3 3100 4-core, 16 gb ddr4 ram , A520 mobo , 500 w psu.

Crashes will usually result in the screen freezing, becoming unresponsive, and then a black screen for a moment, followed by the PC searching for my monitor as if it is looking for hardware, and when found, I return to desktop. Sometimes, the crash is severe enough that it does not find the monitor and a reboot is initiated after about 30 seconds (my guess is that the GPU fails, but then fails to restart).\n\nIt only seems to occur with certain games that are \"newer\" (Rust, Star Wars Battlefront II) but spares some games that are older (Company of Heroes). \n\nCiv VI was also a crash causer, but after lowering settings to minimum I haven't experienced any crashes (even though on max settings I run said game comfortably FPS, just unpredictable crashes). I can't seem to determine which individual setting could be the culprit.\n\nI adjusted the settings for other games with no luck.\n\nI have tried the following:\n\n\\-Ensuring the GPU drivers are the most up to date\n\n\\-Downloading and using nVidia GE Force Experience\n\n\\-Changing PCI Express -&gt; Link State Power Management to \"Off\"\n\n\\-Switching off Vsync\n\n\\-Switching to DX12 in supported games (and then back to DX11 after this didn't seem to resolve anything)\n\n\\-Virus scans\n\n\\-\"Rolling back\" drivers in the device manager, and then reinstalling drivers\n\n\\-Using DDU to remove all drivers in safe mode, and then reinstalling drivers directly from nVIDIA and not Windows update\n\nStill no luck. I do not see large fluctuations in power use or temperature when I am playing. Games that  I used to run for hours 60+ FPS now crash frequently. I built this PC in August and this only became an issue \\~November, with no major software/hardware changes.\n\nI posted this in BuildaPC reddit, and was advised to just completely reinstall windows - I'd prefer not to do this but I will if I have to.\n\nI have crash logs for Civ VI and SW Battlefront II, and can probably get them for Rust, but I have no idea how to open them.

After constantly being belittled he is insecure. I could have had brother ans a sister but they both died before I was born. And that also may have keep toll on him.

Mum adressed all these problems to him he said my life I want to live however I want you don't have a saying. To that mum tightened finances. Pops lied to her wanting to spend more maybe due to envy seeing splurge even though being not being on the condition to do so(bad financial decisions).

He took her to our bedroom and she revealed her lingerie (which she has only worn once for me in 6 months) and started touching her everywhere. He started to finger her, pretty violently in my opinion but she was losing it. I couldnt believe that he made her squirt, a feat I have never accomplished. He stood up and she undid his pants and starts blowing him. The guy was fairly large and thick, Im only 5-5.5\" myself and he had some length on me. She bends over in front of him a few minutes later and he starts fucking her, without a condom. I couldn't fathom this and within a few moments I covered in my own cum.

I wanted to make a beast of a S620 with as many fans as possible, so here it is. Case is configured as a rear and bottom intake to top and side exhaust.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComponents:    \n\nCASE: Sliger S620    \n\nCPU: AMD 5900X    \n\nGPU: Asus TUF RTX 3090 OC (Deshrouded)    \n\nRAM: Crucial Ballistix 3600 Mhz DDR4 32 Gb    \n\nMOTHERBOARD: Asus ROG Strix X570-I with a Fujipoly thermal pad replacing the stock chip thermal pad    \n\nPSU: Cooler Master V850 SFX (Newer model that fixes the fan ramp issue)    \n\nSTORAGE: 2TB Samsung 950 Pro, 1TB Samsung 980 Pro  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCooling:    \n\nController - Corsair Commander Pro    \n\nCPU Cooler - Noctua D15S (mounted inverted to fit an A12x15 above it) using Thermalgrizzly Kryonaut    \n\n2 x Noctua Chromax HS NF-A15s on the D15S in pull configuration    \n\n1 x Noctua Chromax NF-A12x15 on the D15S as a rear push    \n\n1 x Noctua Chromax NF-A12x15 above the D15S as an exhaust    \n\n1 x Noctua NF-A12x25 on top as an exhaust    \n\n1 x Noctua Chromax NF-A12x15 on the side as an exhaust    \n\n2 x Noctua Chromax HS NF-A15s below the GPU as intakes  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 2 A15s on the D15S are daisy chained together \n\nThe 2 A15s below the GPU are daisy chained together \n\nThe 2 A12x15s on and above the D15S are daisy chained together \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img ff68r6vruut61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 97ezqv2uuut61...*\n\nDeshrouding the GPU was pretty easy. There were 6 screws mounting the fan setup that needed to be removed, and then each fan had 4 screws holding it to the heatsink.  \n\nThe only issue was that the metal tabs used to mount the cooler took up too much room to fit the A15s below the GPU, so I had to bend them up with some pliers to make room (similar to other builds I've seen with a deshrouded Asus Strix 3090). \n\nOnce the tabs were bent, the fans fit perfectly and one of the smaller tabs that I didn't have to bend rests on the fans frames, giving the GPU some nice support too. The fans are practically flush with the GPU, so the fit is near perfect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4ry15tzwuut61...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfnpln32vut61.png?width=1361&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a78f62363e62472b663772e6534e5c59ab35d4f8\n\nI initially also had an NF-A9 as a front exhaust, but it created turbulence when running at the same time as the side exhaust NF-A12x15. Since the A12x15 can move more air, I decided to keep it and get rid of the front A9. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img n907s5n3vut61...*\n\nI used the stock cables that came with the Coolermaster PSU. They are rigid, so I had to \"pre-bend\" them before I put them into the case so they wouldn't be pushing against the second A15 or the top of the GPU. I put some grills on the top A12x25 and side A12x15 so the cables wouldn't hit the blades. To reach the power button when the case is fully assembled, I stick a long thin screw driver between the blades of the side exhaust A12x15. The joys of an SFF case lol. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img q2xzj2d5vut61...*\n\nBack view. The PSU gets fresh air from the side and exhausts to the top, which works out really well with the top exhaust configuration. \n\nIn order to fit the PSU and another A15 on the D15S, I mounted it in a \"half-cage\" configuration that's detailed in this other build: [https://imgur.com/gallery/yvA9C11](https://imgur.com/gallery/yvA9C11) \n\nSome 6-32 nuts from Home Depot/Lowes perfectly fit on some of the extra short screws that came with the case, which is how I fastened the cage to the case. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 5oj1ja2avut61...*\n\nFinished build. Didn't show it, but the commander pro is in the front of the case behind the front panel. I just used some double-sided tape to stick it on there and have all the fan cables running through the top and bottom outlets on the front. The front panel fits just fine with the commander pro behind it since its so thin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4h2tzwdvut61.png?width=1363&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3316b84dfa998b743a85256b000fc53ee9565f8c\n\nRan a 1 hour long unnecessary OMEGA stress test consisting of all of the following running at the same time and monitoring with HWinfo: \n\n\\-A 4k Youtube video playing \n\n\\-Unigine Heaven 1440p highest settings \n\n\\-Unigine Superposition 8k highest settings \n\n\\-Aida64 stress test with ALL of the stress settings on (including the GPU and storage) \n\n\\-All stock hardware settings. No manual tweaking of the GPU, CPU, or RAM (aside from enabling DOCP in the BIOS for 3600 Mhz RAM and resizable bar for the GPU)  \n\nFPS for everything was of course garbage, but the main point was to make sure fans and PSU could keep up with the heat and power draw for an extremely unrealistic scenario so that there would be absolutely no worries while gaming. Here were the results: \n\n\\-CPU Max Temp: 79 C \n\n\\-GPU Max Temp: 75 C \n\n\\-GPU VRAM Max Temp: 92 C \n\n\\-Motherboard Max Temp: 46 C \n\nPretty happy with those aside from the VRAM, but thats a known general problem with all 3080s and 3090s regardless of case and coolers. Might replace the VRAM thermal pads eventually since thats been shown to lower temps by around 20 C, but its nothing worrying so I'll leave it for now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wants to do a similar build, here's how I'd recommend assembling it to save some headache: \n\n1. Mount the motherboard to the case \n\n2. Mount the PSU cage (not the PSU yet) \n\n3. Mount the 2 bottom intake A15s and run their cables through the bottom outlet behind the front panel \n\n4. Run the SATA power cable you'll need for the commander pro through bottom outlet behind the front panel (don't connect it to anything yet) \n\n5. Run the commander pro's USB cable through the bottom outlet behind the front panel (don't connect it to the motherboard yet) \n\n6. Mount the GPU, making sure the cables for the commander pro are going past and above it so they'll be able to reach the motherboard when its all connected (the GPU would've gotten in the way of the SATA power cable later, which is why we did it before this step) \n\n7. Attach all the cables you need to the PSU (including the main power cable) \n\n8. Mount the PSU to the cage, run your main power cable to the back of the case, and attach it with whatever option you purchased for the case \n\n9. Attach all your cables (for the PSU, commander pro, power button, etc) to the motherboard \n\n10. Outside of the case, mount the front pull A15 and rear push A12x15 on the D15S. You can't mount the middle A15 or else you wont be able to get to the screws, but there's an issue of the GPU not giving you ANY room to put a fan clip on the bottom of the D15S once its in the case. So here's what I did to fix that:    \n\n   A. Put the bottom fan clip for the middle A15 on the D15S and use a rubber band to hold it in place.   \n   Make sure you'll be able to easily remove the rubberband once the D15S is mounted!    \n\n   B. Mount the D15S on the motherboard    \n\n   C. The bottom fan clip will now be held in place by the GPU, so you can remove the rubber band.    \n\n   D. Put the middle A15 in and use some needle nose pliers or long scissors to pull the inside bottom   \n   fan clip (the one closer to the motherboard) into the clip hole on the A15. Then attach the outside   \n   clip too (you'll be able to reach this one normally)    \n\n   E. Attach the top fan clip to the A15 and D15S \n\n11. Run all the D15S' fan cables along the top of the case through the top outlet behind the front panel (around the power button cables) \n\n12. Slide in and mount the top A12x15 and run its cable along the top of the case through the top outlet behind the front panel \n\n13. Mount the top A12x25 and run its cable along the top of the case through the top outlet behind the front panel \n\n14. Attach your cables to the GPU \n\n15. Mount the side A12x15 and run its cable through the bottom or top outlet behind the front panel \n\n16. Attach the commander pro to the front of the case and plug in all the cables"], "2021-04-19": ["Hey all, as the title suggests, I really want to get the game on my pc as I want to play without my family constantly watching over my shoulder (ya know lol).

They don't fear a semiconductor shortage either.  Easy to root for too.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Let's start with two very important disclaimers:**\n\n* AMD doesn't manufacture their own chips.  Neither does Xilinx.  TSMC and Global Foundries do.\n* Just because you *feel* their product is better, doesn't mean it is *better* from a stock performance standpoint.  No fanboy behavior please.\n\nI am leading with this because it is so important for understanding the difference between liking AMD as a company versus liking them as a stock.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Long ago, in a Valley far far away...\n\n***The year is 1981.***\n\nIBM has created it's first PC and was looking to power it with the HOT SHIT of it's time - the Intel x86 processor.  There was a catch... IBM needed a 'second-source' manufacturer.  This is someone other than Intel who could produce the x86 chips in order to ensure that IBM would always have access.  When Intel scanned the horizon of other early semiconductor companies they went ahead and chose plucky little AMD.\n\nAt this time, you may have forgiven Intel for viewing AMD as their little brother.  They both came from Fairchild Semiconductor in the 60's with AMD's core group (Jerry Sanders +7) leaving less than two years after Noyce and Moore had left to start Intel.  AMD wasn't a competitor at the 'leading edge' of semiconductor design or production.  Remember this is an era when semiconductor companies manufactured their own chips.\n\nIntel had a dominant position in the microprocessor space.  They didn't fear AMD.  So they chose their little brother and signed the agreement which naturally included technology transfers and licensing deals.  With this 'training', AMD would learn a great deal about the ways of silicon.\n\n[Sorry AMD fans but in this analogy you are Whiny-Kin.](https://preview.redd.it/ee83p7ouisv61.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55b7d59ad9a7a518c29c4b13c1de395d4ab4a40f)\n\nOver the next 15 years AMD and Intel would battle over AMD's ability to utilize the x86 architecture taught to them by Intel.  Court cases lead to arbitration lead to more court cases.  This is one of the nastier corporate disagreements and I would rather focus on the outcome of their war because it says what you need to know about AMD.\n\n# AMD's DNA\n\nIntel's falling out with AMD forced **AMD to become great chip designers**.  Everything that comes after 1996 regarding AMD relates to them actively pursuing performance leadership in every category they compete in.   Note that performance leadership means the best performing... not necessarily the highest selling.\n\nThis means that from a corporate DNA standpoint... every decision AMD makes is to produce the 'best' in the future and to dominate the top end of their market.  AMD built upon the x86 architecture while also working with the new ARM architecture - so they could develop better performing chips.   AMD spun out their manufacturing footprint (creating Global Foundries) to focus more effort on developing better performance chips.   When it came time to move into GPUs AMD acquired ATI for 5B because they were already developing the best performing chips.\n\nAMD may enter a segment as a low cost 'value' option (akin to them being second-source manufacturers for others) but this was always to get their foot in the door before developing what would become the performance leader of that category.  When AMD says it's coming for your market... they aren't aiming for anything less than being the best.\n\nAnd why do they do this?  It's simple.\n\n[FUCK Intel](https://preview.redd.it/u110pdt03tv61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f70ac6a8f9b6e49cabfc591801600ae6033e75cf)\n\n***Now let's fast forward... the year is 2020.***\n\n# Exiting the Pandemic\n\nAMD has very cleanly organized itself into 2 segments.\n\n* **Computing and Graphics:** This segment includes their GPUs and CPUs.  Think PCs and laptops.\n* **Enterprise/Embedded/Semi-Custom:** This segment includes their Xbox/PS chips as well as their servers and datacenter chips.\n\nUsing their Q4 2020 results, AMD generates roughly **60%** of their revenue on their Computing/Graphics side with **40%** on the Enterprise Side.  While their C/G business may be where many of you reading this 'know' AMD from (RADEON GPUs or RYZEN CPUs), we need to focus on their 'smaller' side - Enterprise/Embedded/Semi-Custom (E/E/SC).\n\nAMD's E/E/SC segment is where AMD gets to pursue it's true passion: developing stupidly powerful chips while making Intel it's bitch.  This is the business segment that puts AMD chips inside the newest generation of consoles (both Xbox and PS), [supercomputers,](https://www.nextplatform.com/2021/02/09/amd-takes-down-another-supercomputer-deal-in-europe/) servers, crypto mining rigs, and **datacenters** (remember this).\n\n[This is what happens when you can design beyond 10 nm](https://preview.redd.it/r3gnwlzy2nv61.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=384068deb5d4b882972ef2a07241551ba55422df)\n\nComing into 2021, AMD has a well stocked product portfolio with popular performance leaders across several categories.  They even felt confident enough to approach Xilinx for a merger (not going to cover this acquisition here).\n\n# Dude... where's your datacenter customers?\n\nLast week Intel released their Q1 2021 quarterly results.  They beat both revenue and earnings estimates.  Let's see if you spot the moment they released their results by just looking at their stock price against AMD (in yellow):\n\n[FUUUUUUUUUU](https://preview.redd.it/uwczq30fetv61.jpg?width=967&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0483369d62df2b545fac0f5fa7f68d99c8fd79cc)\n\nWhat happened?  It's simple, Intel showed that they lost **20%** of their datacenter revenue.  While Intel CEO and well loved YOLO'er Pat Gelsinger tried to dance around the topic of the gaping hole where their remaining cash cow previously laid... the market was quick to figure it out.  Intel just got its ass kicked in the datacenter.\n\nThe only question was how bad was it?\n\n# AMD's BLOWOUT\n\nIt was bad.  The market was correct.  AMD had whipped Intel's ass.\n\nIn the datacenter, AMD doubled their revenue from a year ago.  They notched significant customer acquisitions like AWS, Oracle, and Microsoft... many of these being previously loyal Intel customers.\n\nOutside of their datacenter they notched revenue gains across all the lines of business along with increased margins due to a better product mix.\n\nHere is how AMD viewed their results:\n\n[Their prior quarter also had record revenue.](https://preview.redd.it/x0g3yvuyjtv61.jpg?width=981&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b745cad7dc76b3d43e2a8751fec81572013281)\n\nWhile the revenue and gross margin numbers are impressive; I want to focus on the bottom where AMD generated $832M in Free Cash Flow (FCF).  FCF for AMD is very nice because AMD is extremely low debt.  As of this quarter, they have 10x the amount of cash/cash equivalents than total debt (300M).  This much cash post-R&amp;D funding represents a lot of tendies AMD can serve to their shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.\n\n# Isn't there a semiconductor shortage?\n\nI believe that semiconductors are just kicking off their own commodity supercycle and this is independent of the existing semiconductor shortage, but I want to show how AMD is well positioned in both the near and far term with where the semiconductor industry is heading.\n\nIn the near term, AMD is not terribly impacted by the shortage because their chips are built on the more advanced processes (less than 10nm sorry Intel).  The chips that are in the most demand for the automotive and appliance industries tend to be the commodity chips built on the less advanced process nodes.  Also, due to their products having nice fat margins, AMD is able to pay more to get their chips moved to the front of line.\n\nIn the long term, I think ALL fabless chip producers are going to benefit from the supercycle as more production coming online means the costs associated with manufacturing should decrease.  As long as the chip designers can charge high prices to the end customer, this will only result in fatter margins and crispier tendies.\n\nIf you are already invested in AMD... you can stop reading here.  Nothing I say is going to change how you feel about them as I am sure you have appreciated their growth over the past few years.\n\n[Trends are soothing...](https://preview.redd.it/izkf13u7otv61.jpg?width=895&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d55d1edb44ae08c02054092567334d48bdbbeb3)\n\nFor everyone who is looking for a scenario to jump into AMD... allow me to present my BULLCASE.\n\n# BULLCASE on AMD: They kill off Intel Design\n\nIntel's YOLO is the idea that Intel will open up as a contract manufacturer for fabless chip designers (like AMD) to become a western version of TSMC.  What may not be apparent is what this actually does to Intel's chip design side of the house.\n\nIn order for Intel to effectively serve as an external foundry, they will have to invest an UNGODLY sum of money just on the manufacturing side.  They may be able to sign checks to ASML and skip a process node completely (just move to 5nm) but all of this represents capital that is not being deployed to design better chips for the datacenter or for the next generation of laptops.  Meanwhile demand for CPUs/GPUs is consistently increasing year over year - particularly along the leading edge of performance where AMD is known to rule.\n\nWhile Intel's production capabilities improve; their design side withers.  Starved of R&amp;D dollars and executive focus, Intel Design fails to keep up with both AMD and the newly merged Nvidia/ARM.\n\nAfter close to a decade of efforts,  Intel Foundry is finally confident about producing semiconductors beyond 10nm.  Is Intel Design ready to be their first customer?\n\nNothing would be more poetic for AMD to have Intel's first 5nm process used on AMD chips.\n\nPositions: none.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**References:**\n\n[DD - Intel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/mp2f3b/dd_semiconductors_intel_intc_the_280b_corporate/)\n\n[Q1 2021 Earnings AMD](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_ee24874d4888cc56b59891df4ac06e6f/amd/db/778/6634/file/AMD+Q1%2721+Financial+Results+Slides.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ------------------- \n\n **[TickerDatabase](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index) entries updated:**\n\n[INTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/INTC)\n\n[MSFT](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/MSFT)\n\n[NVDA](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/NVDA)\n\n[ORCL](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/ORCL)\n\n[XLNX](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/XLNX)\n\n[AMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/AMD)\n\n[ASML](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/ASML)"], "2021-04-29": [" I bought the Best Buy model of the ROG Zephyrus G15 that has an AMD processor, QHD screen, 3070 with 1tb of memory for 1799.

Following up from the recent [FAQ Friday on hardware](https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/comments/mrvdgk/faq_friday_hardware/), I'm doing a series of posts that cover setups at three different levels: consumer, prosumer, and professional. Two weeks ago, the [FAQ Friday covered peripherals](https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/comments/n1lu2t/faq_friday_peripherals/), such as mice, monitors, and control surfaces. Some hardware will make a repeat appearance in the different setups.\n\nAs with all FAQ Fridays, *any* topic is welcome here, not just the subject of the FAQ.\n\n# About These Setup Suggestions\n\nThese requirements will get you going on HD editing with most types of footage. Fusion work is minimal, or basic titles, and optimized media or proxies are a must for H.264 or H.265 footage. Storage isn't included - that's either a future FAQ Friday or another topic of discussion.\n\nIntel vs. AMD and NVIDIA vs. AMD isn't included here on purpose, as it's up to personal preference and availability at the consumer price level.\n\nAlso, while you *can* run Resolve on 8 GB of RAM, it's not ideal - 16 is the minimum suggested amount of RAM. I understand that computers are expensive, but Resolve is not for you if you've got less than 8 GB of RAM.\n\n# All Setups\n\n* A three-button mouse\n* A keyboard, numeric keypad optional\n* Headphones or speakers *not* connected via USB\n* A monitor 17\" in size or greater\n\n# macOS Setup System Suggestions\n\n* macOS 10.15 Catalina or later\n* 8-16 GB of system memory\n* Integrated GPU or discrete GPU with at least 2 GB of VRAM\n* GPU which supports Metal or OpenCL 1.2\n\n# Linux Setup System Suggestions\n\n* CentOS 7.3, a similar distro, or a recent Debian-based distro like Ubuntu\n* A recent i7 or faster CPU (or AMD equivalent)\n* 8-16 GB of system memory\n* Discrete GPU with at least 4 GB of VRAM (NVIDIA recommended)\n* GPU which supports OpenCL 1.2 or CUDA 11\n* NVIDIA/AMD GPU Driver version \u2013 As required by your GPU.\n\n# Windows Setup System Suggestions\n\n* Windows 10 Creators Update\n* 8-16 GB of system memory\n* Integrated GPU or discrete GPU with at least 4 GB of VRAM\n* A recent i7 or faster CPU (or AMD equivalent)\n* GPU which supports OpenCL 1.2 or CUDA 11\n* NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPU Driver version \u2013 As required by your GPU.\\*\n\n\\*There's an issue with NVIDIA Game-Ready driver version 461.09 that has been resolved in later driver versions. Update your GPU drivers to a later version or the Studio version of the NVIDIA drivers. [More information from BMD on changing driver versions.](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=50352&amp;start=100#p713477)\n\n# Detailed Recommendations &amp; Notes\n\nA lot of this is personal preference, but I do have a few recommendations. On the Apple side, I personally recommend a Macbook Pro or Mac Mini. I've got a personal concern about heat with Macbook Airs, but if that's what you want, go for it. On the Windows/Linux side, *most* pre-built gaming laptops or gaming computers that meet these minimum specs should be fine. Expect prices for decently specced systems to start around $900-$1000 USD.\n\nA three-button mouse isn't a hard and fast requirement, but is ideal for quickly copying grades or Fusion compositions with the middle mouse button, or moving the image around in a viewer. Again, you don't have to drop $100 on a mouse - a cheap USB mouse will work fine.\n\nUSB headphones and speakers can have additional tuning introduced to the audio, changing the sound profile. Pre 17.2, these can also cause issues with launching Resolve. You don't have to go out and buy a pair of $80 studio-quality headphones at this level. The built-in speakers on your laptop or a pair of earbuds will work fine.\n\n[**Previous FAQ Fridays**](https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/search?q=flair_name%3A%22FAQ%20Friday%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)"], "2021-05-15": ["Hi there,\n\nI've got a PC that I built a few months ago that's been working fine until a week or two ago.

I'm also not a huge fan of the case as it's mainly plastic and the computer doesn't pop as much as I would like. As well, this isn't really a big thing, but the mouse and keyboard it comes with seem very plain and cheap.\n\nMy second option just sold out a few hours ago so it's not really an option anymore but I'd still be interested to hear thoughts on it.\n\n[https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/ibuypower-slate-4-163a-gaming-pc-black-amd-ryzen-5-3600-1tb-hdd-240gb-ssd-16gb-ram-radeon-rx-580/15348484](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/ibuypower-slate-4-163a-gaming-pc-black-amd-ryzen-5-3600-1tb-hdd-240gb-ssd-16gb-ram-radeon-rx-580/15348484)\n\nOverall the PC seemed great though I'm not really sure about the company as I can't find much information on IBUYPOWER.

As well, I'd like it to be from a Canadian company/website as shipping from America to Canada isn't something I really want to get into.\n\n(Not sure if this is relevant but I have a close family member who is a teacher so I would be able to get a teacher's discount at certain companies)\n\nThanks!"], "2021-05-20": [""], "2021-05-21": ["I just bought this laptop but the battery duration displayed keeps changing.

Following up from the recent [FAQ Friday on hardware](https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/comments/mrvdgk/faq_friday_hardware/), I'm doing a series of posts that cover setups at three different levels: consumer, prosumer, and professional. A few weeks ago, the [FAQ Friday covered peripherals](https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/comments/n1lu2t/faq_friday_peripherals/), such as mice, monitors, and control surfaces. Some hardware will make a repeat appearance in the different setups.\n\n# About These Setup Suggestions\n\nThese requirements will get you going on HD editing with most types of footage. Fusion work is common, and optimized media or proxies are optional for H.264 or H.265 footage. Storage isn't included - that's either a future FAQ Friday or another topic of discussion.\n\nIntel vs. AMD and NVIDIA vs. AMD isn't included here on purpose, as this is the mid-range, and some of it's up to personal preference. I do have some recommendations, but it's not a requirement, which is the point of these posts.\n\n# All Setups\n\n* A three-button mouse and/or a tablet interface, like a Wacom\n* A keyboard with numeric keypad\n* Headphones or speakers *not* connected via USB\n* 2+ monitors 17\" in size or greater\n* Resolve Studio (Key or Dongle version)\n\n# Optional Additions\n\n* An UltraStudio/Decklink\n* A calibrated/calibratable monitor (LG CX, Eizo, or Flanders)\n* A Tangent Ripple, Wave, or Blackmagic Mini Panel (For color correction)\n* Fairlight Desktop Console (For mixing)\n\n# macOS Setup System Suggestions\n\n* macOS 10.15 Catalina or later\n* 16-32 GB of system memory\\*\n* Integrated GPU or discrete GPU with at least 4 GB of VRAM\\*\\*\n* GPU which supports Metal or OpenCL 1.2\n\n# Linux Setup System Suggestions\n\n* CentOS 7.3, a similar distro, or a recent Debian-based distro like Ubuntu\n* A recent i7 or faster CPU (or AMD equivalent)\n* 32 GB of system memory\n* Discrete GPU with at least 6 GB of VRAM\\*\\*\n* GPU which supports OpenCL 1.2 or CUDA 11\n*  NVIDIA/AMD GPU Driver version \u2013 As required by your GPU.\n\n# Windows Setup System Suggestions\n\n* Windows 10 Creators Update\n* 32 GB of system memory\n* Discrete GPU with at least 6 GB of VRAM\\*\\*\n* A recent i7 or faster CPU (or AMD equivalent)\n* GPU which supports OpenCL 1.2 or CUDA 11\n* NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPU Driver version \u2013 As required by your GPU.\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*M1 chips support a maximum of 16 GBs of RAM - if you want more, you'll have to get an Intel Mac.\n\n\\*\\*If you regularly work with or in 4K, 8 GB of VRAM is recommended.\n\n\\*\\*\\*There's an issue with NVIDIA Game-Ready driver version 461.09 that has been resolved in later driver versions. Update your GPU drivers to a later version or the Studio version of the NVIDIA drivers. [More information from BMD on changing driver versions.](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=50352&amp;start=100#p713477)\n\n# Detailed Recommendations &amp; Notes\n\nOn the Apple side, Intel Macbooks, Mac Minis, and iMacs are best. Puget Systems' \"Free\" version is a good starting point for Windows or Linux. Older \"Trash Can\" Mac Pros or old servers with room for plenty of RAM and/or multiple GPUs are also good.\n\nIf you're more on the professional side than the consumer side of \"prosumer,\" try to go with an NVIDIA GPU. They're the industry standard for Hollywood. Obviously, there's a GPU shortage, so if all you can find is an AMD GPU, that's fine too.\n\nA three-button mouse isn't a hard and fast requirement, but is ideal for quickly copying grades or Fusion compositions with the middle mouse button, or moving the image around in a viewer. I like the Logitech MX Master 2S personally.\n\nUSB headphones and speakers can have additional tuning introduced to the audio, changing the sound profile. You still don't have to drop $80 on studio-quality headphones, but it's a good investment.\n\n[**Previous FAQ Fridays**](https://www.reddit.com/r/davinciresolve/search?q=flair_name%3A%22FAQ%20Friday%22&amp;restrict_sr=1)"], "2021-05-23": ["I got lucky and recently got my hands on one.
